A.",2014,Clinical review of two fatal equine cases of infection with the insectivorous bat strain of Australian bat lyssavirus,"CASE SERIES: The first two confirmed cases of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection in horses are presented. Both cases occurred in the same week in May 2013 in paddock mates in south-east Queensland. Australia has been one of only a few countries considered free from rabies-like viruses in domestic animal species. ABLV infection had previously only been confirmed in bats and humans. All three confirmed human cases were fatal, the latest in February 2013. An additional human case of possible abortive infection in 1996 has also been reported. Both equine cases reported here resulted in euthanasia. The risks of infection across other mammalian species are still to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: These two equine cases highlight that ABLV should be considered as a differential diagnosis in animals with similar clinical presentations in Australia. There is a need for greater awareness regarding the zoonotic risk, use of personal protective equipment, pre- and post-exposure prophylactic measures and laboratory diagnostic options. The authors recommend ABLV testing for all Australian cases of progressive equine neurological disease.",Journal Article,Aust Vet J,92,9,324-32,"Animals;DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics;Fatal Outcome;Female;Histocytochemistry/veterinary;Horse Diseases/*virology;Horses;Lyssavirus/genetics/*isolation & purification;Male;Nervous System Diseases/*veterinary/virology;Queensland;Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary;Rhabdoviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology;Zoonoses/*virology;Australian bat lyssavirus;equine encephalitis;equine rabies;zoonoses",25156050,10.1111/avj.12227,0005-0423,australian bat lyssavirus,Mononegavirales,Rhabdoviridae,Lyssavirus,zoonotic,insectivorous bat,horse,"Direct contact, Reproductive, Oral",,,,Endoneurium of Schwann cells,transynaptic spread,Clathrin-mediated endocytosis,unknown,CNS,,Intermittent,High,n,Neurons,CNS,,,,,,,,,,,,,Recent Observations on Australian Bat Lyssavirus Tropism and Viral Entry - PMC (nih.gov),,

In this study, the complete open reading frame (ORF) 2, the 3' end of ORF1b and the corresponding intergenic region of astroviruses identified in farmed guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) were sequenced and genetically analysed. Overall, the genetic sequence of guinea fowl astroviruses was related to turkey astrovirus type 2 (TastV2), although a marked genetic distance was revealed based on ORF2, which might indicate the circulation of a distinct virus genotype and serotype in guinea fowl. Furthermore, the genetic data presented herein suggest that either recombination between different astroviruses infecting distinct hosts or adaptation of a given astrovirus to a new host had occurred.

However, information on case frequencies, clinical courses, and detailed epidemiological analyses are still lacking. We report the occurrence of BoDV-1-associated encephalitis in cases submitted to the Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, Regensburg University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany, and provide a detailed description of newly identified cases of BoDV-1-induced encephalitis. METHODS: All brain tissues from 56 encephalitis cases from Bavaria, Germany, of putative viral origin (1999-2019), which had been submitted for virological testing upon request of the attending clinician and stored for stepwise diagnostic procedure, were systematically screened for BoDV-1 RNA. Two additional BoDV-1-positive cases were contributed by other diagnostic centres. Positive results were confirmed by deep sequencing, antigen detection, and determination of BoDV-1-reactive antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical and epidemiological data from infected patients were collected and analysed. FINDINGS: BoDV-1 RNA and bornavirus-reactive antibodies were detected in eight newly analysed encephalitis cases and the first human BoDV-1 isolate was obtained from an unequivocally confirmed human BoDV-1 infection from the endemic area. Six of the eight BoDV-1-positive patients had no record of immunosuppression before the onset of fatal disease, whereas two were immunocompromised after solid organ transplantation. Typical initial symptoms were headache, fever, and confusion, followed by various neurological signs, deep coma, and severe brainstem involvement. Seven of nine patients with fatal encephalitis of unclear cause were BoDV-1 positive within one diagnostic centre. BoDV-1 sequence information and epidemiological analyses indicated independent spillover transmissions most likely from the local wild animal reservoir. INTERPRETATION: BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions.

In this study, we collected rectal swabs from a total of 1,498 cattle, sheep and goats. BCoV detection was based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Sanger sequencing of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region for postive samples were done and nucleotide sequences were compared with homologous sequences from the GenBank. RESULTS: The study reports a BCoV prevalence of 0.3%, consisting of 4 positive cases; 3 goats and 1 cattle. Less than 10% of all the animals sampled showed clinical signs such as diarrhea and respiratory distress except for high temperature which occurred in >?1000 of the animals. However, none of the 4 BCoV positive animals manifested any clinical signs of the infection at the time of sample collection. Bayesian majority-rule cladogram comparing partial and full length BCoV RdRp genes obtained in the study to data from the GenBank revealed that the sequences obtained from this study formed one large monophyletic group with those from different species and countries. The goat sequences were similar to each other and clustered within the same clade. No major variations were thus observed betweenßour isolates and those from elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: Given that Ghana predominantly practices the extensive and semi-intensive systems of animal rearing, our study highlights the potential for spillover of BCoV to small ruminants in settings with mixed husbandry and limited separation between species.",Journal Article,BMC Vet Res,16,1,405,"Animals;Base Sequence;Bayes Theorem;Cattle;Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/*virology;Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Coronavirus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification;Diarrhea/veterinary;Ghana/epidemiology;Goat Diseases/epidemiology/*virology;Goats;Phylogeny;Prevalence;RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase/genetics;Respiratory Distress Syndrome/veterinary;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary;Sheep;Sheep Diseases/epidemiology/*virology;Bovine coronavirus;Cross-species infection;Goat",33109183,10.1186/s12917-020-02606-x,1746-6148,bovine coronavirus,nidovirales,coronaviridae,betacoronavirus,not_zoonotic,cattle,goat,"Direct contact, Reproductive, Oral",,,,,gastrointestinal,," N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid, ?-2.6-(SA), HLA-1",intestinal epithelium,,,,,intestinal epithelial cells,gastrointestinal,,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers | Bovine Coronavirus and the Associated Diseases (frontiersin.org),,

Restrictions due to notifiable epizootics complicate the exchange of samples in surveillance studies and suggest that laboratory capacities should be established domestically. Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) causes mainly enteric disease in cattle. Spillover to small ruminants is possible. Here we established BCoV serology based on a recombinant immunofluorescence assay for cattle, goats and sheep, and studied the seroprevalence of BCoV in these species in four different locations in the Greater Accra, Volta, Upper East, and Northern provinces of Ghana. The whole sampling and testing was organized and conducted by a veterinary school in Kumasi, Ashanti Region of Ghana. Among sampled sheep (n = 102), goats (n = 66), and cattle (n = 1495), the seroprevalence rates were 25.8 %, 43.1 % and 55.8 %. For cattle, seroprevalence was significantly higher on larger farms (82.2 % vs 17.8 %, comparing farms with >50 or <50 animals; p = 0.027). Highest prevalence was seen in the Northern province with dry climate, but no significant trend following the north-south gradient of sampling sites was detected.

Worldwide, there is evidence of BVDV exposure and infection in wild ungulates; however, the frequency and significance of such events are unknown. To determine the prevalence and distribution of Colorado deer, elk, and moose persistently infected (PI) with BVDV, a cross-sectional study was conducted using full-thickness ear tissue samples collected from animals presented to the Colorado Division of Wildlife for chronic wasting disease surveillance in the 2005-2006 hunting season. Tissue from 5,597 harvested animals (2,934 mule deer, 2,516 elk, 141 white-tailed deer, and 6 moose) was paraffin-embedded and stained for BVDV using immunohistochemistry. A single adult male mule deer had BVDV antigen in the skin; staining distribution was consistent with that seen in PI cattle. Skin and lymph node were also positive for viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the virus was determined to be a type 1. The prevalence of BVDV PI cervids in Colorado is very low. However, the identification of a naturally infected adult PI animal in the wild suggests that the virus infects free-ranging populations.

Antibody prevalence for brucellosis (2.5%) and tularaemia (32%) were identical for grizzly bears and black bears from the geographical area of interior Alaska. Links between differences in prevalence and the origin of the grizzly bears were observed. Antibodies to canine distemper virus and infectious hepatitis virus were mainly detected in grizzly bears from Kodiak Island and the Alaskan Peninsula. Brucellosis antibodies were prevalent in grizzly bears from western and northern Alaska, whereas tularaemia antibodies were detected in grizzly bears from interior Alaska and the Arctic. There was a strong gradient for antibodies to Trichinella spp. from southern to northern Alaska. For most diseases, antibody prevalence increased with age. However, for several infections, no antibodies were detected in grizzly bears aged from 0 to 2 years, in contrast to the presence of those infections in black bears.

Genomic sequencing of CDV isolated from one of the infected pandas (giant panda/SX/2014) suggests it belongs to the Asia-1 cluster.

This study (March 2001 to October 2003) collated case data, serologic, pathologic, and molecular data to describe the spillover of CDV from domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) to black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) during an epidemic on the Namibian coast. Antibody prevalence in jackals peaked at 74.1%, and the clinical signs and histopathologic observations closely resembled those observed in domestic dog cases. Viral RNA was isolated from the brain of a domestic dog from the outbreak area. Sequence data from the phosphoprotein (P) gene and the hemagglutinin (H) genes were used for phylogenetic analyses. The P gene sequence from the domestic dog shared 98% identity with the sequence data available for other CDV isolates of African carnivores. For the H gene, the two sequences available from the outbreak that decimated the lion population in Tanzania in 1994 were the closest match with the Namibian sample, being 94% identical across 1,122 base pairs (bp). Phylogenetic analyses based on this region clustered the Namibian sample with the CDV that is within the morbilliviruses. This is the first description of an epidemic involving black-backed jackals in Namibia, demonstrating that this species has the capacity for rapid and large-scale dissemination of CDV.

A propensity for host-switching has resulted in CDV emergence in new species, including endangered wildlife, posing challenges for controlling disease in multispecies communities. CDV is typically associated with domestic dogs, but little is known about its maintenance and transmission in species-rich areas or about the potential role of domestic dog vaccination as a means of reducing disease threats to wildlife. We address these questions by analyzing a long-term serological dataset of CDV in lions and domestic dogs from Tanzania's Serengeti ecosystem. Using a Bayesian state-space model, we show that dynamics of CDV have changed considerably over the past three decades. Initially, peaks of CDV infection in dogs preceded those in lions, suggesting that spill-over from dogs was the main driver of infection in wildlife. However, despite dog-to-lion transmission dominating cross-species transmission models, infection peaks in lions became more frequent and asynchronous from those in dogs, suggesting that other wildlife species may play a role in a potentially complex maintenance community. Widespread mass vaccination of domestic dogs reduced the probability of infection in dogs and the size of outbreaks but did not prevent transmission to or peaks of infection in lions. This study demonstrates the complexity of CDV dynamics in natural ecosystems and the value of long-term, large-scale datasets for investigating transmission patterns and evaluating disease control strategies.",Journal Article,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,112,5,1464-9,"Animals;*Animals, Domestic;*Animals, Wild;Bayes Theorem;Distemper/transmission/virology;Distemper Virus, Canine/*pathogenicity/physiology;Dogs;Lions;Morbillivirus/*pathogenicity/physiology;cross-species transmission;multihost pathogens;reservoirs;serology;state?space models;vaccines for the mass dog vaccination campaigns from MSD Animal Health (formerly;Intervet and Intervet Schering-Plough).",25605919,10.1073/pnas.1411623112,0027-8424 (Print);0027-8424,canine distemper virus,Mononegavirales,Paramyxoviridae,Morbillivirus,not_zoonotic,domestic dog,lion,Direct,,,,,lymphatic,,"SLAM, Nectin-9","lymphoid cells, epithelial cells",,,,,"epithelial, lymphoid, neural","integument, lymphatic, neurological, respiratory",,,,,,,,,,,,,Tropism and molecular pathogenesis of canine distemper virus | Virology Journal | Full Text (biomedcentral.com),,

Here we investigated SRLV phylogenetic group variants in sheep. CAEV-like isolates, belonging to phylogenetic group C, were found among both seropositive sheep and goats in mixed flocks, in which sheep and goats are kept together. Intra-herd clustering confirmed that mixed flock animals were infected by the same virus variant, suggesting ongoing interspecies transmission. Few sheep flocks were found to be infected with the MVV-like phylogenetic group A. The apparent absence of SRLV group A type in goats is probably due to the MVV control programme and animal management practices. SRLV group C targets lungs and mammary glands in sheep, and induces typical SRLV pathological lesions. SRLV group C isolated from the sheep mammary glands suggested a productive infection and potential for transmission to offspring. SRLV group C was most prevalent among goats. A lower PCR sensitivity in seropositive sheep suggested a lower load of SRLV group C provirus in sheep than in goats. Higher genetic divergence of group C than in other SRLV groups and extensive heterogeneity among group C isolates in the matrix C-terminal region demonstrate the need for identifying conserved target regions when developing PCR protocols for SRLV detection.

The local populations reported no unusual morbidity or mortality among wild or domestic animals, but they described a massive annual fruit bat migration toward the southeast, up the Lulua River. Migrating bats settled in the outbreak area for several weeks, between April and May, nestling in the numerous fruit trees in Ndongo and Koumelele islands as well as in palm trees of a largely abandoned plantation. They were massively hunted by villagers, for whom they represented a major source of protein.

Among the Felidae, numerous immunodeficiency-like lentiviruses have been documented, but only a few cross-species transmissions have been recorded, and these have not been perpetuated in the recipient species. Lentivirus seroprevalence was determined for 79 bobcats (Lynx rufus) and 31 pumas (Puma concolor) from well-defined populations in Southern California. Partial genomic sequences were subsequently obtained from 18 and 12 seropositive bobcats and pumas, respectively. Genotypes were analyzed for phylogenic relatedness and genotypic composition among the study set and archived feline lentivirus sequences. This investigation of feline immunodeficiency virus infection in bobcats and pumas of Southern California provides evidence that cross-species infection has occurred frequently among these animals. The data suggest that transmission has occurred in multiple locations and are most consistent with the spread of the virus from bobcats to pumas. Although the ultimate causes remain unknown, these transmission events may occur as a result of puma predation on bobcats, a situation similar to that which fostered transmission of HIV to humans, and likely represent the emergence of a lentivirus with relaxed barriers to cross-species transmission.

The current study was planned to investigate an FMD outbreak in the wild ungulate species in the Jallo Wildlife Park and breeding facility, Lahore, Pakistan from Mar 2021- Jun 2021. The disease was confirmed based on ELISA through the detection of antibodies against the non-structural protein of FMD virus and typical clinical signs of oral and feet lesions, and even partial or complete hoof shedding in severe cases. To investigate the possible cause of FMD spillover and its pattern, a series of interviews were conducted with wildlife practitioners, animal handlers, and the local veterinarians in villages adjacent to the park. The data revealed neither vaccination nor any FMD outbreak in the last 10 years. The epidemic curve and time-series analysis showed a mixed outbreak characterized by the introduction of disease and then propagative spread from infected to susceptible animals. After the first reports of clinical signs in Blackbuck, Urial and Mouflon sheep were infected while in the end, the cases were reported from the enclosures of Sambar deer and Spotted deer. The morbidity rate among all the wild ungulate species was 92% and the mean mortality rate was 27%. The study concluded that possible sources for primary disease incidence might be animal handlers having FMD infected animals in their houses and transport vehicles coming from adjacent disease-affected villages. For the disease spread between enclosures, another possibility of wind-borne FMD virus spread could also be considered.

Evidence suggests that human exposure and infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes (GT) 3 and 4 results from zoonotic transmission. Hypothesising that HEV GT3 and GT4 are circulating in the Vietnamese pig population and can be transmitted to humans, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of HEV exposure in a population of farmers and the general population. We additionally performed sequence analysis of HEV in pig populations in the same region to address knowledge gaps regarding HEV circulation and to evaluate if pigs were a potential source of HEV exposure.

HEV strains included in the Orthohepevirus A species infect humans and several other mammals. Among them, the HEV-3 and HEV-4 genotypes are zoonotic and infect both humans and animals, of which,ßpigs and wild boar are the main reservoirs. Viruses belonging to the Orthohepevirus C species (HEV-C) have been considered to infect rats of different species and carnivores. Recently, two studies reported the detection of HEV-C1 (rat HEV) RNA in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, suggesting a possible transmission of rat HEV to humans. The role of rats and mice as reservoir of HEV and the potential zoonotic transmission is still poorly known and deserves further investigation. To this purpose, in this study, the presence of HEV RNA was investigated in the intestinal contents and liver samples from 47 Black rats (Rattus rattus) and 21 House mice (Mus musculus) captured in four pig farms in Northern Italy. The presence of both Orthohepevirus A and C was investigated by the real-rime RT-PCR specific for HEV-1 to HEV-4 genotypes of Orthohepevirus A species and by a broad spectrum hemi-nested RT-PCR capable of detecting different HEV species including rat HEV. The intestinal content from two Black rats resulted positive for HEV-C1 RNA and for HEV-3 RNA, respectively. None of the House mice was HEV RNA positive. Sequence analyses confirmed the detection of HEV-C1, genotype G1 and HEV-3 subtype e. The viral strain HEV-3e detected in the rat was identical to swine HEV strains detected in the same farm.

Whereas domestic pigs and wild boars are well-known animal reservoirs for HEV, the knowledge on natural HEV infection in zoo animals is scarce so far. Here, we analysed 244 sera from 66 mammal species derived from three zoos in Germany using a commercial double antigen sandwich ELISA. HEV-specific antibodies were detected in 16 animal species, with the highest detection rates in suids (33.3%) and carnivores (27.0%). However, RNA of the human pathogenic HEV genotypes 1-4 was not detected in the serum samples from suids or carnivores. Using a broad spectrum RT-PCR, a ratHEV-related sequence was identified in a sample of a female Syrian brown bear (Ursus arctos syriacus). Subsequent serum samples within a period of five years confirmed a HEV seroconversion in this animal. No symptoms of hepatitis were recorded. In a follow-up investigation at the same location, closely related ratHEV sequences were identified in free-living Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), whereas feeder rats (Rattus norvegicus forma domestica) were negative for HEV-specific antibodies and RNA. Therefore, a spillover infection of ratHEV from free-living Norway rats is most likely.

HEV species C genotype 1 (HEV-C1) circulates in rats and is highly divergent from HEV-A. It was previously considered unable to infect humans, but the first case of human HEV-C1 infection was recently discovered in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to further describe the features of this zoonosis in Hong Kong. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted a territory-wide prospective screening study for HEV-C1 infection over a 31-month period. Blood samples from 2,860 patients with abnormal liver function (nß=ß2,201) or immunosuppressive conditions (nß=ß659) were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. In addition, 186 captured commensal rats were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. Sequences of human-derived and rat-derived HEV-C1 isolates were compared. Epidemiological and clinical features of HEV-C1 infection were analyzed. HEV-C1 RNA was detected in 6/2,201 (0.27%) patients with hepatitis and 1/659 (0.15%) immunocompromised persons. Including the previously reported case, eight HEV-C1 infections were identified, including five in patients who were immunosuppressed. Three patients had acute hepatitis, four had persistent hepatitis, and one had subclinical infection without hepatitis. One patient died of meningoencephalitis, and HEV-C1 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. HEV-C1 hepatitis was generally milder than HEV-A hepatitis. HEV-C1 RNA was detected in 7/186 (3.76%) rats. One HEV-C1 isolate obtained from a rat captured near the residences of patients was closely related to the major outbreak strain. CONCLUSIONS: HEV-C1 is a cause of hepatitis E in humans in Hong Kong. Immunosuppressed individuals are susceptible to persistent HEV-C1 infection and extrahepatic manifestations. Subclinical HEV-C1 infection threatens blood safety.

Rabbit HEV is now known to be widely prevalent in rabbits and tentatively assigned into genotype 3 (HEV-3) as subgenotype-3ra (HEV-3ra). However, its role in human infection remains undetermined. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of HEV infection among rabbit slaughterhouse workers and to identify whether the workers exposed to rabbits are at a higher risk of HEV infection. Seventy-five workers at rabbit slaughterhouses and a control group of 421 general adults in the same area in Hebei province, China, were serologically examined for anti-HEV antibodies. HEV seroprevalences between the slaughterhouse workers and the general adults were compared. Age-adjusted prevalence of anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the rabbit slaughterhouse workers and control group was 46.1% and 10.8% respectively. The slaughterhouse workers had significantly higher seroprevalence and an approximately 6.9-fold increased risk for being seropositive for anti-HEV IgG as compared to the general population (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% CI: 4.3, 10.9). In slaughterhouse workers, anti-HEV IgG positive rate was positively associated with working years; in general adults, this rate was positively associated with age. The prevalence of anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) among exposed workers (6.7%) was significantly higher than that of control groups (1.2%).

Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017. The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R(0) of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts.

With 31% of United Kingdom households owning a dog, this could prove to be an important transmission route. To examine this risk, canine tissues were studied for their ability to bind to HuNoV in vitro. In addition, canine stool samples were analyzed for the presence of viral nucleic acid, and canine serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-HuNoV antibodies. The results showed that seven different genotypes of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) can bind to canine gastrointestinal tissue, suggesting that infection is at least theoretically possible. Although HuNoV RNA was not identified in stool samples from 248 dogs, serological evidence of previous exposure to HuNoV was obtained in 43/325 canine serum samples. Remarkably, canine seroprevalence for different HuNoV genotypes mirrored the seroprevalence in the human population. Though entry and replication within cells have not been demonstrated, the canine serological data indicate that dogs produce an immune response to HuNoV, implying productive infection.

Virus transmission can occur via the faecal-oral route from person to person or via contaminated food, water, or surfaces. The most common NoV strains circulating among humans belong to genogroup GII. Thus far, to our knowledge, no HuNoVs have been detected in pets. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether pet dogs could serve as carriers for HuNoVs and thereby transmit the infection to humans. STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-two faecal samples of indoor pet dogs were obtained. The main criteria for sample collection were that the dog or humans in the household had suffered from diarrhoea or vomiting. All samples were screened for HuNoV genogroups GI, GII, and GIV by real-time one-step RT-PCR. RESULTS: We detected HuNoV in four faecal samples from pet dogs that had been in direct contact with symptomatic persons. Three of the positive samples contained genotype GII.4 variant 2006b or 2008 and one GII.12. All NoV-positive dogs lived in households with small children and two dogs showed mild symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HuNoVs can survive in the canine gastrointestinal tract.

Here we report simultaneous outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January 2017. The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R(0) of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts.

In this study, we conducted serological surveillance to assess the prevalence of novel pandemic H1N1 as well as seasonal human influenza virus infections in domestic cats in Ohio. Four hundred serum samples collected from domestic cats (September 2009 to September 2010) were tested using a hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test.

Skunks (Mephitis mephitis) are a reservoir of skunk strain rabies virus in Canada, with the exception of some areas including the province of British Columbia (BC). Beyond rabies, the reservoir status of skunks for emerging and zoonotic pathogens in BC is unknown. From March 2011 to February 2015, 50 free-ranging skunks were necropsied and tested for 4 pathogens: influenza A, Aleutian disease virus (ADV), Leptospira spp. and Salmonella spp. Two skunks (4%) with respiratory disease caused by influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 were detected during the human flu season suggesting that skunks may represent a target population for reverse zoonosis of this strain of influenza A virus. High prevalence of ADV infection was detected (43/50, 86%). Two of the infected skunks exhibited Aleutian disease (AD) suggesting that skunks act as both a reservoir and a target population for the virus. Most studies of ADV have focused on the potential for infection of free-ranging species living near mink farms. Our study suggests that urban skunks may be a primary host for the virus independent of domestic mink. Whether skunks act as a reservoir of ADV infection for other peridomestic species will depend on host specificity of the viral strains. Leptospira interrogans was detected in 18% (9/49) of the skunks. Identification of the serovar(s) detected is needed to determine any public health risk of leptospirosis following exposure to infected skunks. Salmonella spp. was isolated from three of 43 skunks (7%), specifically S. Typhimurium, S. Muenchen and S. Enteritidis.

METHODS: Beginning in 2015, we used a One Health approach and serial sampling to prospectively study 299 swine workers and 100 controls, their 9000 pigs, and 6 pig farm environments in China for influenza A viruses (IAVs) using molecular, culture, and immunological techniques. Study participants were closely monitored for influenza-like illness (ILI) events. RESULTS: Upon enrollment, swine workers had higher serum neutralizing antibody titers against swine H1N1 and higher nasal wash total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and specific IgA titers against swine H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Over a period of 12 months, IAVs were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in 46 of 396 (11.6%) environmental swabs, 235 of 3300 (7.1%) pig oral secretion, 23 of 396 (5.8%) water, 20 of 396 (5.1%) aerosol, and 19 of 396 (4.8%) fecal-slurry specimens. Five of 32 (15.6%) participants with ILI events had nasopharyngeal swab specimens that were positive for IAV, and 17 (53.1%) demonstrated 4-fold rises in neutralization titers against a swine virus. Reassorted Eurasian avian-lineage H1N1, A(H1N1)pdm09-like, and swine-lineage H3N2 viruses were identified in pig farms. The A(H1N1)pdm09-like H1N1 viruses identified in swine were nearly genetically identical to the human H1N1 viruses isolated from the participants with ILI. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable evidence of A(H1N1)pdm09-like, swine-lineage H1N1, and swine-lineage H3N2 viruses circulating, likely reassorting, and likely crossing species within the pig farms.

Although Brazil has one of the largest swine populations in the world, influenza was not thought to be endemic in Brazil's swine until the major outbreaks of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009. Through phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences of influenza viruses of the H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes collected in swine in Brazil during 2009-2012, we identified multiple previously uncharacterized influenza viruses of human seasonal H1N2 and H3N2 virus origin that have circulated undetected in swine for more than a decade.

We present the first evidence of influenza A virus infection in household dogs in Mexico. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs. METHODS: Serum samples from household dogs and their owners were analyzed to detect the presence of antibodies against three subtypes of human influenza virus (H1N1pdm09, H1N1, and H3N2), as well as subtype H3N8 of equine influenza. We analyzed dog nasal exudates to detect influenza viral RNA. The relationship between the seropositivity of dogs and various factors (age, sex, constantly at home, and seropositivity of owners) was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Seroprevalence for human influenza in dogs was 0?9% (1 of 113), and it was 4% (5 of 113) for equine influenza. In humans, seroprevalence was 22% for subtype H1N1pdm09, 20% for subtype H1N1, and 11% for subtype H3N2. No significant association (P>0?05) was found between seropositivity and any of the assessed factors. Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected in the nasal exudate samples.

While sporadic human infections with classical influenza A (H1N1) and with tr-swine influenza viruses have been reported, relatively few have been documented in occupationally exposed swine workers (SW). METHODS: We conducted a 2-year (2002-2004) prospective cohort study of transmission of influenza viruses between pigs and SW from a single pork production company in Iowa. Respiratory samples were collected and tested for influenza viruses from SW and from pigs under their care through surveillance for influenza-like illnesses (ILI). Serial blood samples from study participants were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) for antibody seroconversion against human and swine influenza viruses (SIV), and antibody seroprevalence was compared to age-matched urban Iowa blood donors. RESULTS: During the first year, 15 of 88 SW had ILI and were sampled; all were culture-negative for influenza. During the second year, 11 of 76 SW had ILI and were sampled; one was culture-positive for a human seasonal H3N2 virus. Among 20 swine herd ILI outbreaks sampled, influenza A virus was detected by rRT-PCR from 17 with 11 trH1N1 and five trH3N2 virus isolates cultured. During both years, HI geometric mean titers were significantly higher among SW compared to blood donor controls for three SIV: classical swine Sw/WI/238/97 (H1N1), tr Sw/IN/9K035/99 (H1N2), and trSw/IA/H02NJ56371/02 (H1N1)] (P < 0?0001).

The PB2, HA and NA genes contained unique amino acid changes compared to the available new H1N1 influenza virus sequences of pig origin. Furthermore, the investigated strains could be separated with respect to parallel amino acid substitutions affecting the polymerase genes (PB2, PB1 and PA) and the nucleoprotein (NP) gene, supporting the proposed complementarities between these proteins, all required for the viral fitness. Molecular characterisation of two Hungarian human pandemic H1N1 isolates was also performed, so that we could compare contemporaneous strains of different host species origins.

While some reverse zoonotic-origin viruses adapt and become enzootic in swine, nascent reverse zoonoses may result in virus detections that are difficult to classify as ""swine-origin"" or ""human-origin"" due to the genetic similarity of circulating viruses. This is the case for human-origin influenza A(H1N1) pandemic 2009 (pdm09) viruses detected in pigs following numerous reverse zoonosis events since the 2009 pandemic. We report the identification of two human infections with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses originating from swine hosts and classify them as ""swine-origin"" variant influenza viruses based on phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison methods. Phylogenetic analyses of viral genomes from two cases revealed these viruses were reassortants containing A(H1N1)pdm09 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes with genetic combinations derived from the triple reassortant internal gene cassette. Follow-up investigations determined that one individual had direct exposure to swine in the week preceding illness onset, while another did not report swine exposure. The swine-origin A(H1N1) variant cases were resolved by full genome sequence comparison of the variant viruses to swine influenza genomes. However, if reassortment does not result in the acquisition of swine-associated genes and swine virus genomic sequences are not available from the exposure source, future cases may not be discernible. We have developed a pipeline that performs maximum likelihood analyses, a k-mer-based set difference algorithm, and random forest algorithms to identify swine-associated sequences in the hemagglutinin gene to differentiate between human-origin and swine-origin A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.IMPORTANCE Influenza virus infects a wide range of hosts, resulting in illnesses that vary from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and death. Viral transfer can occur between human and nonhuman hosts, resulting in human and nonhuman origin viruses circulating in novel hosts. In this work, we have identified the first case of a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus resulting in a human infection. This shows that these viruses not only circulate in swine hosts, but are continuing to evolve and distinguish themselves from previously circulating human-origin influenza viruses. The development of techniques for distinguishing human-origin and swine-origin viruses are necessary for the continued surveillance of influenza viruses. We show that unique genetic signatures can differentiate circulating swine-associated strains from circulating human-associated strains of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and these signatures can be used to enhance surveillance of swine-origin influenza.",Journal Article,J Virol,95,2,,"Adult;Aged;Animals;Dogs;Female;Genome, Viral/genetics;Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/genetics;Humans;Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Influenza, Human/transmission/*virology;Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells;Male;Neuraminidase/genetics;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*virology;Pandemics/*veterinary;Phylogeny;Reassortant Viruses/classification/genetics/isolation & purification;Swine;Viral Proteins/genetics;Zoonoses/transmission/*virology;*A(H1N1)pdm09;*influenza;*pandemic;*random forest;*swine-origin;*zoonotic transmission",33115872,10.1128/jvi.01066-20,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x,influenza A H1N1,Articulavirales,Orthomyxoviridae,Alphainfluenzavirus,zoonotic,pig,human,"Direct contact, Airborne, Fomite","aerosol, droplets, and fomites",Nasal secretions,epithelium of the nasal cavity and large airways,,epithelial,recptor-mediated endocytosis,"Sialic acid (SA?2,3Gal and SA?2,6Gal receptors)",respiratory epithelium,Days,Transient,Low,,epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract,Respiratory,Days,"pigs, human",Narrow,2,2,RNA,SS,80–120,enveloped,TRUE,13444.6,,,,

Marine mammals are in contact with a number of influenza reservoirs, including aquatic birds and humans, and this may facilitate transmission among avian and mammalian hosts. Virus isolation, whole genome sequencing, and hemagluttination inhibition assay confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 influenza virus occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals (Mirounga angustirostris) in 2010. Nasal swabs were collected from 42 adult female seals in April 2010, just after the animals had returned to the central California coast from their short post-breeding migration in the northeast Pacific. Swabs from two seals tested positive by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, and virus was isolated from each by inoculation into embryonic chicken eggs. Whole genome sequencing revealed greater than 99% homology with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) that emerged in humans from swine in 2009. Analysis of more than 300 serum samples showed that samples collected early in 2010 (n?=?100) were negative and by April animals began to test positive for antibodies against the pH1N1 virus (HI titer of ?1?40), supporting the molecular findings. In vitro characterizations studies revealed that viral replication was indistinguishable from that of reference strains of pH1N1 in canine kidney cells, but replication was inefficient in human epithelial respiratory cells, indicating these isolates may be elephant seal adapted viruses. Thus findings confirmed that exposure to pandemic H1N1 that was circulating in people in 2009 occurred among free-ranging Northern Elephant Seals in 2010 off the central California coast.

From a food tray swab which tested weakly positive by a commercial influenza detection kit, we were able to obtain the whole-genome sequence of the influenza A virus. Analysis of the genome, A/cheetah/Kanagawa/2/2019(H1N1), revealed that the virus was closely related to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated from humans in Japan in the 2018-2019 winter.

These viruses, referred to as human-like H3N2 viruses, have been known to cause clinical and subclinical infections of swine populations. Due to the paucity and complete unavailability of information on transmission of influenza viruses from other species, especially humans, to swine in Nigeria and Ghana, respectively, this study was designed to investigate the presence and prevalence of a human strain of influenza A (H3N2) in swine populations at three locations in two cities within these two West African countries in January and February, 2014. Using stratified random technique, nasal swab specimens were collected from seventy-five (75) pigs at two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and from fifty (50) pigs in Kumasi, Ghana. These specimens were tested directly by a sensitive Quantitative Solid Phase Antigen-detection Sandwich ELISA using anti-A/Brisbane/10/2007 haemagglutinin monoclonal antibody. Influenza virus A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) was detected among pigs at the three study locations, with an aggregate prevalence of 4.0% for the two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and also 4.0% for Kumasi, Ghana. Transmission of influenza viruses from other species to swine portends serious sinister prospects for genetic reassortment and evolvement of novel viruses. We therefore recommend that further studies should be carried out to investigate the presence of other circulating human and avian influenza viruses in swine populations in West Africa and also determine the extent of genetic reassortment of strains circulating among these pigs.

An H3N2 variant was circulating in humans in the 1990s and subsequently introduced into the pig population in the 2000s. This virus gradually became the main subtype of swine influenza virus worldwide. However, there were no reports of infections in dogs with this virus. FINDINGS: In 2013, 35 nasal swabs from pet dogs were positive for Influenza A virus by RT-PCR. Two viruses were isolated and genetically characterized. In the phylogenetic trees of all gene segments, two H3N2 canine isolates clustered with Moscow/10/99 and most H3N2 swine influenza viruses. These results indicated that two H3N2 CIVs possessed high homology with human/swine influenza viruses, which at the same time exhibited some amino acid substitutions in NA, polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), and nucleoprotein (NP), which probably were related to the interspecies transmission.

Canine species were considered to be the new natural hosts for this virus. However, at the beginning of 2010, influenza-like respiratory signs, such as dyspnoea, were also observed among cats as well as in dogs in an animal shelter located in Seoul, South Korea. The affected cats showed 100?% morbidity and 40?% mortality. We were able to isolate a virus from a lung specimen of a dead cat, which had suffered from the respiratory disease, in embryonated-chicken eggs. The eight viral genes isolated were almost identical to those of the canine influenza H3N2 virus, suggesting interspecies transmission of canine influenza H3N2 virus to the cat. Moreover, three domestic cats infected with intranasal canine/Korea/GCVP01/07 (H3N2) all showed elevated rectal temperatures, nasal virus shedding and severe pulmonary lesions, such as suppurative bronchopneumonia. Our study shows, for the first time, that cats are susceptible to canine influenza H3N2 infection, suggesting that cats may play an intermediate host role in transmitting the H3N2 virus among feline and canine species, which could lead to the endemic establishment of the virus in companion animals. Such a scenario raises a public health concern, as the possibility of the emergence of new recombinant feline or canine influenza viruses in companion animals with the potential to act as a zoonotic infection cannot be excluded.",Journal Article,J Gen Virol,92,Pt 10,2350-2355,"Animals;Body Temperature;Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology/*virology;Cats;Cluster Analysis;Dog Diseases/epidemiology/pathology/*transmission/*virology;Dogs;Feces/virology;Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Lung/virology;Molecular Sequence Data;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Phylogeny;RNA, Viral/genetics;Republic of Korea/epidemiology;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Virus Shedding",21715595,10.1099/vir.0.033522-0,0022-1317,influenza a H3N2,Articulavirales,Orthomyxoviridae,Alphainfluenzavirus,zoonotic,domestic dog,domestic cat,"Direct contact, Airborne, Fomite","aerosol, droplets, and fomites",Nasal secretions,epithelium of the nasal cavity and large airways,,epithelial,recptor-mediated endocytosis,"Sialic acid (SA?2,3Gal and SA?2,6Gal receptors)",respiratory epithelium,Days,Transient,Low,,epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract,Respiratory,Days,"pigs, human",Narrow,2,2,RNA,SS,80–120,enveloped,TRUE,13444.6,,,,

Sequence analysis of postmortem samples revealed the presence of an avian H3N8 influenza A virus, similar to a virus circulating in North American waterfowl since at least 2002 but with mutations that indicate recent adaption to mammalian hosts. These include a D701N mutation in the viral PB2 protein, previously reported in highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses infecting people. Lectin staining and agglutination assays indicated the presence of the avian-preferred SA?-2,3 and mammalian SA?-2,6 receptors in seal respiratory tract, and the ability of the virus to agglutinate erythrocytes bearing either the SA?-2,3 or the SA?-2,6 receptor. The emergence of this A/harbor seal/Massachusetts/1/2011 virus may herald the appearance of an H3N8 influenza clade with potential for persistence and cross-species transmission. IMPORTANCE: The emergence of new strains of influenza virus is always of great public concern, especially when the infection of a new mammalian host has the potential to result in a widespread outbreak of disease. Here we report the emergence of an avian influenza virus (H3N8) in New England harbor seals which caused an outbreak of pneumonia and contributed to a U.S. federally recognized unusual mortality event (UME). This outbreak is particularly significant, not only because of the disease it caused in seals but also because the virus has naturally acquired mutations that are known to increase transmissibility and virulence in mammals.

To effectively prevent the transmission of viruses from live poultry to humans, people have been forced to change their living habits from purchasing live poultry for consumption to purchasing freshly slaughtered poultry after the permanent closure of live poultry markets in China. In this study, we reported a case of human infection by the H5N6 virus in Hangzhou after exposure to a freshly slaughtered chicken, defying the traditional hypothesis that human infection requires a history of exposure to live poultry and indicating a novel route of infection. Rapid genomic characterization of H5N6 influenza A variants from the patient and the associated environment suggested that these viral variants were of avian origin, belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b H5 and were adapting to the human host after infection. Comparative analysis of the local H5N6 genomes showed that viral contamination in the associated environment and the poultry market was complex. Considering this case of H5N6 infection, conducting surveillance for any possible new avian influenza virus reassortment spillover to humans or other animal species is critical, and awareness of the risk of exposure to possible viral variants from infected slaughtered poultry or the associated environment must be seriously improved.Highlights We reported the first case of human infection with avian-origin influenza A (H5N6) virus in Zhejiang Province, southeastern China.Rapid genomic characterization of H5N6 influenza A variants from a patient and the associated environment suggested that these viral variants were of avian origin and were adapting to the human host after infection.Comparative analysis of the H5N6 genomes showed that viral contamination in the associated environment and poultry market was complex.Considering this case of H5N6 infection, the risk of exposure to possible viral variants from infected slaughtered poultry or the associated environment must be seriously considered.",Journal Article,Emerg Microbes Infect,11,1,807-810,"Animals;Chickens;China/epidemiology;Humans;*Influenza A virus/genetics;*Influenza in Birds;*Influenza, Human;Phylogeny;Poultry;*Poultry Diseases;A (H5N6) virus;Avian influenza virus;genomic characterization;human infection;slaughtered poultry",35234570,10.1080/22221751.2022.2048971,2222-1751,influenza a H5N6,Articulavirales,Orthomyxoviridae,Alphainfluenzavirus,zoonotic,poultry ,human,"Direct contact, Airborne, Fomite","aerosol, droplets, and fomites",Nasal secretions,epithelium of the nasal cavity and large airways,,epithelial,recptor-mediated endocytosis,"Sialic acid (SA?2,3Gal and SA?2,6Gal receptors)",respiratory epithelium,Days,Transient,Low,,epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract,Respiratory,Days,"pigs, human",Narrow,2,2,RNA,SS,80–120,enveloped,TRUE,13444.6,,,,

We report the clinical and microbiological features of patients infected with influenza A H7N9 virus and compare genomic features of the human virus with those of the virus in market poultry in Zhejiang, China. METHODS: Between March 7 and April 8, 2013, we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infiltrate, and laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection. We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines. We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples. We identified and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing. RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient's and the chicken's isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes. FINDINGS: We identified four patients (mean age 56 years), all of whom had contact with poultry 3-8 days before disease onset. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression. Two patients died. Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs. The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken. All viral gene segments were of avian origin. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affinity for ?-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation). Ser31Asn mutation, which is associated with adamantane resistance, was noted in viral M2. INTERPRETATION: Cross species poultry-to-person transmission of this new reassortant H7N9 virus is associated with severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in human beings. Monitoring of the viral evolution and further study of disease pathogenesis will improve disease management, epidemic control, and pandemic preparedness.

Each cluster was investigated because diagnostic evaluations were unrevealing, and in each a common donor was recognized. METHODS: We examined clinical specimens from the two donors and eight recipients, using viral culture, electron microscopy, serologic testing, molecular analysis, and histopathological examination with immunohistochemical staining to identify a cause. Epidemiologic investigations, including interviews, environmental assessments, and medical-record reviews, were performed to characterize clinical courses and to determine the cause of the illnesses. RESULTS: Laboratory testing revealed lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in all the recipients, with a single, unique strain of LCMV identified in each cluster. In both investigations, LCMV could not be detected in the organ donor. In the 2005 cluster, the donor had had contact in her home with a pet hamster infected with an LCMV strain identical to that detected in the organ recipients; no source of LCMV infection was found in the 2003 cluster. The transplant recipients had abdominal pain, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, elevated aminotransferase levels, coagulopathy, graft dysfunction, and either fever or leukocytosis within three weeks after transplantation. Diarrhea, peri-incisional rash, renal failure, and seizures were variably present. Seven of the eight recipients died, 9 to 76 days after transplantation.

The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans. METHODS: This study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (2014-2016). Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected. Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection. The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: The data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle. MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels. Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV. The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula.

Initially, two employees were admitted to hospital and serologically diagnosed with hantavirus infection. Subsequently, further investigations were conducted. By means of a self-administered questionnaire, three additional symptomatic cases could be identified. The hospital patients' sera were investigated and revealed in one patient a partial PUUV L segment sequence, which was identical to PUUV sequences from several bank voles collected in close proximity to company buildings.

Presently, in Europe, the disease is caused mainly by Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2/b or Lagovirus europaeus GI.2), the origin of which is still unclear, as no RHDV2 reservoir hosts were identified. After the RHDV2 emergence in 2010, viral RNA was detected in a few rodent species. Furthermore, RHDV2 was found to cause disease in some hare species resembling the disease in rabbits, evidencing the ability of the virus to cross the species barrier. In this study, through molecular, histopathologic, antigenic and morphological evidences, we demonstrate the presence and replication of RHDV2 in Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) found dead in the district of Santar?m, Portugal, between March 2017 and January 2020. In these animals, we further classify the RHDV2 as a Lagovirus europaeus recombinant GI.4P-GI.2. Our results indicate that Meles meles is susceptible to RHDV2, developing systemic infection, and excreting the virus in the faeces.

Since 1986, RHDV has caused outbreaks in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Europe, but never in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus, EBH). In 2010, a new RHDV-related virus, called RHDV2, emerged in Europe, causing extended epidemics because it largely overcame the immunity to RHDV present in most rabbit populations. RHDV2 also was identified in Cape hare (Lepus capensis subsp. mediterraneus) and in Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus). Here, we describe two distinct incidents of RHDV2 infection in EBH that occurred in Italy (2012) and Spain (2014). The two RHDV2 strains caused macroscopic and microscopic lesions similar to European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in hares, and they were genetically related to other RHDV2 strains in Europe. EBHs are common in Europe, often sharing habitat with rabbits. They likely have been exposed to high levels of RHDV2 during outbreaks in rabbits in recent years, yet only two incidents of RHDV2 in EBHs have been found in Italy and Spain, suggesting that EBHs are not a primary host. Instead, they may act as spillover hosts inßsituations when infection pressure is high and barriers between rabbits and hares are limited, resulting in occasional infections causing EBHS-like lesions. The serological survey of stocked hare sera taken from Italian and Spanish hare populations provided an understanding of naturally occurring RHDV2 infection in the field confirming its sporadic occurrence in EBH.

These are challenging in any circumstances, but particularly during conflict. Here we describe available human rabies surveillance data from Iraq, results of renewed sampling for rabies in animals, and the first genetic characterisation of circulating rabies strains from Iraq. Human rabies is notifiable, with reported cases increasing since 2003, and a marked increase in Baghdad between 2009 and 2010. These changes coincide with increasing numbers of reported dog bites. There is no laboratory confirmation of disease or virus characterisation and no systematic surveillance for rabies in animals. To address these issues, brain samples were collected from domestic animals in the greater Baghdad region and tested for rabies. Three of 40 brain samples were positive using the fluorescent antibody test and hemi-nested RT-PCR for rabies virus (RABV). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis using partial nucleoprotein gene sequences derived from the samples demonstrated the viruses belong to a single virus variant and share a common ancestor with viruses from neighbouring countries, 22 (95% HPD 14-32) years ago.

However, rabies remains a problem, due to the presence of the virus in bat populations throughout the region, including vampire bats. Vampire bats obtain nutrition exclusively through consuming blood by biting mammals and birds. This makes the species a highly efficient vector of the rabies virus, responsible for sporadic outbreaks of rabies in human populations and numerous cases of rabies in livestock. This, in turn, causes economic losses to the farming industry in countries throughout the region. For over four decades, efforts to control rabies have been directed at controlling the reservoir species and vaccinating cattle. However, this approach has not eliminated rabies in livestock. A major barrier to innovation in vampire rabies control is a lack of consistent surveillance to establish the extent of the problem. This precludes any calculation of its cost to the economy or the cost of potential solutions, such as vaccinating livestock.

The primary hosts are mammalian species in the orders Carnivora and Chiroptera. Since the late 1980s, RABV has been isolated from non-human primates, Callithrix jacchus (the white-tufted marmoset), in four coastal states (Rio Grande do Norte, Cear?, Piau? and Pernambuco) in north-eastern Brazil, where this species is indigenous. The original habitat of C.ßjacchus consisted of two Brazilian biomes, the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga. However, these marmosets have since adapted to other ecosystems as a result of human activities. Between 1988 and 1989, RABV isolates were obtained from white-tufted marmosets in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, but antigenic and genetic identification studies were not conducted at that time. In the following years, three additional states reported cases (Cear?, Piau? and Pernambuco). In two of these states (Cear? and Piau?), human cases of rabies transmitted by marmosets were reported. According to Brazilian Health Ministry data, at least 19 human cases in which this species was the source of infection were registered in between 1990 and 2016. Recent findings in laboratory tests of 12 rabid samples from humans and marmosets and the regional transmission among these animals for over 20ßyears, together with the gradual increase in the affected geographic area, support the concept of the emergence of a new RABV reservoir. Regional tourism, the wild animal trade and the cultural practice of maintaining these animals as pets, particularly in coastal regions, appear to be major risk factors for the increase in human cases. Additional epidemiological and ecological studies are required to better understand local disease dynamics and to identify ideal opportunities for prevention and control of this fatal infection.",Journal Article,Zoonoses Public Health,66,1,47-59,"Amino Acid Substitution;Animals;Antigens, Viral;Brazil/epidemiology;*Callithrix;Disease Reservoirs/*veterinary/virology;Genome, Viral;Humans;Monkey Diseases/epidemiology/*virology;Phylogeny;Rabies/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Rabies virus/genetics/*isolation & purification;*Brazil;*emerging diseases;*lyssavirus;*marmosets;*rabies;*rabies virus;*reservoirs;*zoonosis",30288933,10.1111/zph.12527,1863-1959,rabies virus,Mononegavirales,Rhabdoviridae,Lyssavirus,zoonotic,white-tufted marmoset,human,Direct contact/Inoculation,Bite wound,Saliva,Striated or connective tissue at the inoculation site,Endoneurium of Schwann cells,transynaptic spread,Clathrin-mediated endocytosis,"nAchR

In this paper, we report an incidence of rabid fox bites in a village in southern part of India involving 18 individuals, including 4 children. All people had category III exposures, including bites on the face and neck. The attacking fox was killed by the forest department and buried immediately. The victims of the fox bite did not receive appropriate and adequate postexposure treatment. Thirteen days after the bite, one of the bite victims developed typical symptoms of furious rabies and died 2 days later in a local hospital. His brain tissue, obtained at autopsy, was strongly positive for rabies by fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) and virus isolation. Panic prevailed in the community and the rest of the 17 cases were referred to our institute for advice and further management. Only 35% of them had protective levels of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA). All of the patients were administered with an 8-site intradermal regimen with purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) vaccine and were followed up regularly. All of them developed adequate titers (>0.5?IU/mL) of RVNA 7 days later. They were under regular follow-up and after nearly 2 years none have developed rabies. The partial Nucleoprotein (N) gene sequencing of the virus isolate from the patient who died of rabies had close homology with species I (prototype rabies) sequences available in GenBank and our own past isolates from dogs and humans, thus confirming that virus spillover from wildlife to domestic dogs continues to occur.

We investigated the possible drivers of the 2016 outbreak and established its origin. Using spatio-temporal locations of cases, we applied logistic regression and Geographic Information System techniques to investigate environmental covariates driving occurrences of emerging rabies cases in Gauteng Province. About 53.8% of laboratory-confirmed lyssaviruses in Gauteng Province in 2016 originated from jackals. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from a partial region of the glycoprotein gene of these and historical rabies viruses (RABVs) demonstrated the lyssaviruses to be of canid origin with 97.7% nucleotide sequence similarity. The major cluster comprised jackal RABVs from the 2012 KwaZulu/Natal outbreak and the 2016 outbreak in Gauteng Province. The second cluster was composed of both jackal and dog RABVs. Both clusters correlated with independent RABV introductions into Gauteng by dogs and jackals, respectively.

In the Arctic, the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is regarded as the principal reservoir, but there is considerable debate about how the disease persists at the low population densities that are typical for this species. We describe an outbreak of rabies among Arctic foxes and Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) during 2011-12 on the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, an area with a very low and relatively stable Arctic fox density. The aim of the research was to increase knowledge of Arctic rabies in this ecosystem and in the presumed spillover host, the Svalbard reindeer. Phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus (RABV) RNA isolates from Arctic fox and reindeer was performed, and clinical observations and histologic and immunohistochemical findings in reindeer were described. An ongoing capture-mark-recapture project allowed collection of serum samples from clinically healthy reindeer from the affected population for detection of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies. The outbreak was caused by at least two different variants belonging to the RABV Arctic-2 and Arctic-3 clades, which suggests that rabies was introduced to Svalbard on at least two different occasions. The RABV variants found in Arctic fox and reindeer were similar within locations, suggesting that Arctic foxes and reindeer acquired the infection from the same source(s). The histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings in 10 reindeer were consistent with descriptions in other species infected with RABV of non-Arctic lineages. Evidence of RABV was detected in both brain and salivary gland samples.

Due to segmented nature of dsRNA genome and wide host range, vast genetic and antigenic diversity exists amongst different isolates of rotaviruses. A total of 230 fecal ovine and caprine samples collected from organized farms and villages in Haryana were screened for rotavirus detection. Samples were screened by latex agglutination test and RNA-PAGE followed by RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing. The latex agglutination test showed 25 newborn lamb and 4 kid fecal samples positive for rotavirus. However, RNA-PAGE showed only 9 lamb fecal samples positive for rotavirus. All the samples were subjected to RT-PCR employing vp4 and vp7 gene specific primers of group A rotavirus of ovine, bovine and human origin. Only two samples from lamb (Sheep18/Hisar/2013 and Sheep22/Hisar/2013) showed vp4 and vp7 gene specific amplification with human group A rotavirus (GAR) specific primer. However, they did not show any amplification with ovine and bovine rotavirus specific primers.

Based on nucleotide similarity search, Sheep18/Hisar/2013 and Sheep22/Hisar/2013 isolates were genotyped as G1P[8] and G1P[4]. Phylogenetic analysis also confirmed that these isolates were clustered closely with human rotaviruses from different regions of the world.

M.",2013,Identification by full-genome analysis of a bovine rotavirus transmitted directly to and causing diarrhea in a human child,"The genome of rotaviruses consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, and each genome segment has multiple genotypes. Thus, the genotype constellation of an isolate is often indicative of its host species. Albeit rarely, interspecies transmission occurs either by virions with nonreassorted or reassorted genomic segments. A rotavirus with the G6P[1] genotype, Ro8059, was isolated from the stool of a 1-year-old child during routine characterization of diarrheal specimens from a sentinel clinic in Israel in 1995. Since genotype G6P[1] is generally associated with bovine rotaviruses, and the child developed diarrhea within days of his first contact with calves at an urban farm, the aim of this study was to characterize the whole genomic constellation of Ro8059 and four G6P[1] bovine strains, BRV101, BRV105, BRV106, and CR231/39, by RNA-RNA hybridization and full genome sequencing to determine whether some or all of the segments were of bovine origin. The genome constellations of all four bovine G6P[1] strains were G6-P[1]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 for VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Ro8059 shared the same genotype constellation with these bovine strains, with high nucleotide sequence identities (95.84 to 100%) for each of the 11 segments indicating that Ro8059 represented a direct interspecies whole-genome transmission of a nonreassorted rotavirus from a calf to a human infant. We conclude that this was the earliest example with a complete epidemiological link in which an entirely bovine rotavirus directly infected a human child and caused a symptomatic diarrheal illness. Thus, not all bovine rotaviruses are always naturally attenuated to the human host.",Journal Article,J Clin Microbiol,51,1,182-9,"Animals;Cattle;Diarrhea/*virology;Feces/virology;Genome, Viral;Genotype;Humans;Infant;Israel;Male;Molecular Sequence Data;Nucleic Acid Hybridization;RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification;Rotavirus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Rotavirus Infections/*transmission/*virology;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Zoonoses/*transmission/*virology",23115264,10.1128/jcm.02062-12,0095-1137 (Print);0095-1137,rotavirus,Reoviridae,Reoviridae,Rotavirus,zoonotic,cattle,human,"Oral, Fomite","Fecal–oral route, contaminated rearing pens or water",Feces,,,gastrointestinal,"receptor-mediated endocytosis, or direct penetration","Various integrins, sialic acid residues",,,,,,,,1–24hours,"humans, cattle, swine, horses, gallinaceous

A total of 147 humans and 897 rats were tested. METHODS: In addition to immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM serology and traditional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), novel quantitative RT-PCR primers/probe were developed, and whole genome sequencing was performed. RESULTS: Seventeen people had SEOV IgM, indicating recent infection; 7 reported symptoms and 3 were hospitalized. All patients recovered. Thirty-one facilities in 11 US states had SEOV infection, and among those with ?10 rats tested, rat IgG prevalence ranged 2%-70% and SEOV RT-PCR positivity ranged 0%-70%. Human laboratory-confirmed cases were significantly associated with rat IgG positivity and RT-PCR positivity (P = .03 and P = .006, respectively). Genomic sequencing identified >99.5% homology between SEOV sequences in this outbreak, and these were >99% identical to SEOV associated with previous pet rat infections in England, the Netherlands, and France. Frequent trade of rats between home-based ratteries contributed to transmission of SEOV between facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Pet rat owners, breeders, and the healthcare and public health community should be aware and take steps to prevent SEOV transmission in pet rats and to humans.

S.",2020,Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Associated with Manual De-Ticking of Domestic Dogs,"Background: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease. SFTS is caused by the SFTS virus, a novel phlebovirus, and is spread by ticks. Methods: A 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of fever and was diagnosed with confirmed SFTS. An epidemiological investigation was conducted, and immunofluorescent antibody assays (IFAs) were performed to determine the role of the patient's three dogs in the transmission. PCR assays were performed using ticks that were collected with the dragging and flagging method from the patient's dogs and home. Results: PCR results were positive, and IFA confirmed an increased antibody titer. Although the reverse transcription PCR results of the three dogs were negative for SFTS virus, one dog had an elevated SFTS IFA immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of 1:1,024. Moreover, a number of ticks were observed in the area surrounding the dog cages. Based on the findings of the patient interview, the patient was likely to have acquired SFTS by blood splash because he removed or burst ticks from the dogs with his bare hands. Although no tick bites were reported, tick transmission could not be ruled out. Studies have shown that only one in three individuals with a diagnosis of SFTS recalls a tick bite; thus, a definite exclusion of tick transmission in this case was not possible. Conclusions: The epidemiological findings of our case suggest a possible relationship between tick infestation in domestic dogs and SFTS virus transmission to humans. However, there is no direct evidence supporting this viral transmission route.

During our sero-survey of SFTS virus (SFTSV) among veterinary professionals in 2018, a veterinarian and his assistant working in an animal hospital were tested positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An additional survey implied a cluster of SFTS cases in which four more people, a family who brought two sick dogs to the animal hospital in 2003, were involved. This study aimed at assessing the possibility of animal-to-human transmission of SFTSV in this cluster. METHODS: Retrospective interviews were performed with the owner family of the dogs and their clinical records were obtained from each hospital. SFTSV-IgG were tested by ELISA and virus neutralization test using the sera collected from them in 2018. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that a total of six people, the two veterinary professionals and the owner family who took care of the sick dogs, suffered from SFTS-like symptoms in the same period of time in 2003. All patients did not have tick bite before the onset and all suspected causative agents were excluded by laboratory tests. The serological tests in this study revealed the four owner family members were all positive for SFTSV antibodies.

We studied 1,321 people from the general adult population (mean age 49 yrs, 640 women and 681 men) and 198 individuals, mostly men, all of whom had encountered a NHP with a resulting bite or scratch. All of these, either Pygmies (436) or Bantus (1085) live in villages in South Cameroon. A specific SFV Western blot was used and two nested PCRs (polymerase, and LTR) were done on all the positive/borderline samples by serology.

The passage of another simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from apes or monkeys to humans has been reported. Mandrillus sphinx, a monkey species living in central Africa, is naturally infected with SFV. We evaluated the natural history of the virus in a free-ranging colony of mandrills and investigated possible transmission of mandrill SFV to humans. RESULTS: We studied 84 semi-free-ranging captive mandrills at the Primate Centre of the Centre International de Recherches M?dicales de Franceville (Gabon) and 15 wild mandrills caught in various areas of the country. The presence of SFV was also evaluated in 20 people who worked closely with mandrills and other nonhuman primates. SFV infection was determined by specific serological (Western blot) and molecular (nested PCR of the integrase region in the polymerase gene) assays. Seropositivity for SFV was found in 70/84 (83%) captive and 9/15 (60%) wild-caught mandrills and in 2/20 (10%) humans. The 425-bp SFV integrase fragment was detected in peripheral blood DNA from 53 captive and 8 wild-caught mandrills and in two personnel. Sequence and phylogenetic studies demonstrated the presence of two distinct strains of mandrill SFV, one clade including SFVs from mandrills living in the northern part of Gabon and the second consisting of SFV from animals living in the south. One man who had been bitten 10 years earlier by a mandrill and another bitten 22 years earlier by a macaque were found to be SFV infected, both at the Primate Centre. The second man had a sequence close to SFVmac sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of the virus from the first man and from the mandrill showed nearly identical sequences, indicating genetic stability of SFV over time. CONCLUSION: Our results show a high prevalence of SFV infection in a semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills, with the presence of two different strains.

Genomic DNA from blood and buccal swabs was analyzed for the presence of proviral SFV sequences by three nested PCR tests and a new quantitative PCR assay. Exposure histories were obtained and analyzed for associations with possible SFV infection. Ten persons (18%) tested seropositive and two persons were seroindeterminate (3.6%) for NWP SFV. Six persons had seroreactivity over 2-3 years suggestive of persistent infection. All SFV NWP WB-positive workers reported at least one incident involving NWP, including six reporting NWP bites. NWP SFV viral DNA was not detected in the blood or buccal swabs from all 12 NWP SFV seroreactive workers.

These retroviruses include simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV), simian type D retrovirus (SRV), and simian foamy virus (SFV). Although occasional infection with SIV, SRV, or SFV in persons occupationally exposed to NHPs has been reported, the characteristics and significance of these zoonotic infections are not fully defined. Surveillance for simian retroviruses at three research centers and two zoos identified no SIV, SRV, or STLV infection in 187 participants.

While simian foamy virus (SFV) infection was reported in primate hunters in Cameroon and Gabon, little is known about the distribution of SFV in Africa and whether human-to-human transmission and disease occur. We screened 3,334 plasmas from persons living in rural villages in central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using SFV-specific EIA and Western blot (WB) tests. PCR amplification of SFV polymerase sequences from DNA extracted from buffy coats was used to measure proviral loads. Phylogenetic analysis was used to define the NHP species origin of SFV. Participants completed questionnaires to capture NHP exposure information. RESULTS: Sixteen (0.5%) samples were WB-positive; 12 of 16 were from women (75%, 95% confidence limits 47.6%, 92.7%). Sequence analysis detected SFV in three women originating from Angolan colobus or red-tailed monkeys; both monkeys are hunted frequently in DRC. NHP exposure varied and infected women lived in distant villages suggesting a wide and potentially diverse distribution of SFV infections across DRC. Plasmas from 22 contacts of 8 WB-positive participants were all WB negative suggesting no secondary viral transmission. Proviral loads in the three women ranged from 14 - 1,755 copies/105 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study documents SFV infection in rural DRC for the first time and identifies infections with novel SFV variants from Colobus and red-tailed monkeys. Unlike previous studies, women were not at lower risk for SFV infection in our population, providing opportunities for spread of SFV both horizontally and vertically. However, limited testing of close contacts of WB-positive persons did not identify human-to-human transmission. Combined with the broad behavioral risk and distribution of NHPs across DRC, our results suggest that SFV infection may have a wider geographic distribution within DRC. These results also reinforce the potential for an increased SFV prevalence throughout the forested regions of Africa where humans and simians co-exist. Our finding of endemic foci of SFV infection in DRC will facilitate longitudinal studies to determine the potential for person-to-person transmissibility and pathogenicity of these zoonotic retroviral infections.",Journal Article,Retrovirology,9,,100,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Animals;Child;Child, Preschool;Colobus;Congo;Female;Humans;Infant;Middle Aged;Monkey Diseases/*transmission;Phylogeny;Retroviridae Infections/*transmission;Simian foamy virus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Viral Load;Zoonoses/transmission",23217108,10.1186/1742-4690-9-100,1742-4690,Simian foamy virus,ortervirales,retroviridae,spumavirus,zoonotic,"angolan colobus monkey, red-tailed monkey",human,Direct Contact,"bite/scratch, blood-borne",saliva,,,unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,,persistant,none,,"lymphoid, neural, epithelial",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated zoonotic infection in individuals living in central Africa. METHODS: We obtained behavioural data, plasma samples, and peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals living in rural villages in Cameroon. We did serological testing, PCR, and sequence analysis to obtain evidence of retrovirus infection. FINDINGS: Zoonotic infections with simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus endemic in most Old World primates, were identified in people living in central African forests who reported direct contact with blood and body fluids of wild non-human primates. Ten (1%) of 1099 individuals had antibodies to SFV. Sequence analysis from these individuals revealed three geographically-independent human SFV infections, each of which was acquired from a distinct non-human primate lineage: De Brazza's guenon (Cercopithecus neglectus), mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), two of which (De Brazza's guenon and mandrill) are naturally infected with SIV. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that retroviruses are actively crossing into human populations, and demonstrate that people in central Africa are currently infected with SFV.

Elevated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) seroprevalence rates have been reported for the different AGM subspecies. We report here the extent to which patas monkeys are infected and compare the relatedness of the viruses isolated from theses two different species. Among the 85 AGMs and 54 patas monkeys studied, 47% of 7.5%, respectively, had antibodies that cross-reacted with HIV-2 envelope proteins. From two AGMs a virus was isolated. From the patas monkeys, virus isolation was generally not possible, but from one animal that was ill a virus designated pamG31 was amplified by PCR. In addition, for the two SIVagm isolates, an 830 bp region spanning the env and nef genes was amplified and sequenced. Comparisons of sequences from the env/nef region revealed 80% identity between pam G31 and SIVagm isolates from AGMs of the sabaeus subspecies, and 94% identity between the two SIVagm isolates.

However, the zoonotic potential of this agent has not been well defined. Screening for antibodies to SRV was performed as part of an ongoing study looking for evidence of infection with simian retroviruses among persons occupationally exposed to nonhuman primates (NHPs). Of 231 persons tested, 2 (0.9%) were found to be strongly seropositive, showing reactivity against multiple SRV antigens representing gag, pol, and env gene products by Western immunoblotting. Persistent long-standing seropositivity, as well as neutralizing antibody specific to SRV type 2, was documented in one individual (subject 1), while waning antibody with eventual seroreversion was observed in a second (subject 2). Repeated attempts to detect SRV by isolation in tissue culture and by using sensitive PCR assays for amplification of two SRV gene regions (gag and pol) were negative. Both individuals remain apparently healthy. We were also unable to transmit this seropositivity to an SRV-negative macaque by using inoculation of whole blood from subject 1. The results of this study provide evidence that occupational exposure to NHPs may increase the risk of infection with SRV and underscore the importance of both occupational safety practices and efforts to eliminate this virus from established macaque colonies.",Journal Article,J Virol,75,4,1783-9,"Animals;Antibodies, Viral/blood;DNA, Viral/blood;Humans;Macaca mulatta;Monkey Diseases/*transmission/virology;Neutralization Tests;*Occupational Exposure;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Retroviridae Infections/*transmission/virology;Retroviruses, Simian/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification;Tumor Virus Infections/*transmission/virology;*Zoonoses",11160676,10.1128/jvi.75.4.1783-1789.2001,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x,simian type D retrovirus,ortervirales,retroviridae,betaretrovirus,zoonotic,macaque,human,direct,,,,,,,neutral amino acid transporter,,,,,,"t-cells, macrophages, b-cells, epithelial cells",immune,,,,,,,,,,,,,The RD114/simian type D retrovirus receptor is a neutral amino acid transporter - PMC (nih.gov),,

Environmental assessment and genetic comparison of the patient's hantavirus isolates to hantavirus isolates from rodents trapped at possible sites of exposure suggested that the patient contracted his infection at the work site. The study revealed a close correspondence between the patient's viral genotype and that from a rodent trapped at the work site.

More than 300 cases in this ""high-lymphoma stock"" have been registered since 1967. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-related virus was implicated as the etiologic agent of Sukhumi baboon lymphoma. The origin of this virus remained unclear. Two possibilities were originally considered: the origin could be baboon simian T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (STLV-1) or HTLV-1 (before the outbreak started, some Sukhumi baboons were inoculated with human leukemic material). The third possibility entered recently: interspecies transmission of rhesus macaque STLV-1 to baboons. It was prompted by the finding of very close similarity between STLV-1 991-1cc (the strain isolated from a non-Sukhumi baboon inoculated with material from a Sukhumi lymphomatous baboon) and rhesus STLV-1. To test this hypothesis, we investigated 37 Sukhumi STLV-1 isolates from baboons of high-lymphoma stock by PCR discriminating rhesus type and baboon type STLV-1 isolates. All of them were proved to be rhesus type STLV-1. In contrast, all six STLV-1 isolates from baboons belonging to other stocks or populations were of baboon type. The PCR results were fully confirmed by DNA sequence data. The partial env gene gene sequences of all four STLV-1 isolates from Sukhumi lymphomatous baboons were 97 to 100% similar to the sequence of known rhesus STLV-1 and only 85% homologous with the sequence of conventional baboon STLV-1. Thus, interspecies transmission of STLV-1 from rhesus macaques (or closely related species) to baboons occurred at Sukhumi Primate Center.

Understanding the VSBV-1 epidemiology is crucial to develop, implement, and maintain surveillance strategies for the detection and control of animal and human infections. Based on a newly detected human encephalitis case in a zoological garden, epidemiological squirrel trade investigations and molecular phylogeny analyses of VSBV-1 with temporal and spatial resolution were conducted. Phylogenetic analyses indicated a recent emergence of VSBV-1 in European squirrel holdings and several animal-animal and animal-human spill-over infections. Virus phylogeny linked to squirrel trade analysis showed the introduction of a common ancestor of the known current VSBV-1 isolates into captive exotic squirrels in Germany, most likely by Prevost's squirrels (Callosciurus prevostii). The links of the animal trade between private breeders and zoos, the likely introduction pathway of VSBV-1 into Germany, and the role of a primary animal distributor were elucidated. In addition, a seroprevalence study was performed among zoo animal caretakers from VSBV-1 affected zoos. No seropositive healthy zoo animal caretakers were found, underlining a probable high-case fatality rate of human VSBV-1 infections. This study illustrates the network and health consequences of uncontrolled wild pet trading as well as the benefits of molecular epidemiology for elucidation and future prevention of infection chains by zoonotic viruses.
