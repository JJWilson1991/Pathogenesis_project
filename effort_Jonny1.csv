D.",2022,Spillover events of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (recombinant GI.4P-GI.2) from Lagomorpha to Eurasian badger,"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a major threat to domestic and wild European rabbits. Presently, in Europe, the disease is caused mainly by Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2/b or Lagovirus europaeus GI.2), the origin of which is still unclear, as no RHDV2 reservoir hosts were identified. After the RHDV2 emergence in 2010, viral RNA was detected in a few rodent species. Furthermore, RHDV2 was found to cause disease in some hare species resembling the disease in rabbits, evidencing the ability of the virus to cross the species barrier. In this study, through molecular, histopathologic, antigenic and morphological evidences, we demonstrate the presence and replication of RHDV2 in Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) found dead in the district of Santar?m, Portugal, between March 2017 and January 2020. In these animals, we further classify the RHDV2 as a Lagovirus europaeus recombinant GI.4P-GI.2. Our results indicate that Meles meles is susceptible to RHDV2, developing systemic infection, and excreting the virus in the faeces. Given the high viral loads seen in several organs and matrices, we believe that transmission to the wild rabbit is likely. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy data show the presence of calicivirus compatible virions in the nucleus of hepatocytes, which constitutes a paradigm shift for caliciviruses' replication cycle.",Journal Article,Transbound Emerg Dis,69,3,1030-1045,"Animals;*Caliciviridae Infections/veterinary;*Hemorrhagic Disease Virus, Rabbit/genetics;*Lagomorpha;*Lagovirus;*Mustelidae;Phylogeny;Rabbits;Meles meles;Eurasian badger;Gi.2;RHDV2/b;recombinant GI.4P-GI.2;spillover event",33683820,10.1111/tbed.14059,1865-1674

The study area consisted of two parts, including mainland and islands. On the mainland, the study was conducted in nine randomly selected villages and camps. On the islands, samples were collected from all four available sites. A total of 985 serum samples were collected and 924 were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for RVF. A total of 561 samples collected from islands were analyzed using ELISA for Q fever and both ELISA and Rose Bengal tests (RBT) for brucellosis. The apparent RVF seroprevalence by species was 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.2-41.3) in cattle, 18.8% (95% CI 12.3-25.2) in goats, and 10.8% (95% CI 3.0-18.5) in sheep. For brucellosis and Q fever, only cattle samples from islands were analyzed. For Q fever, the apparent seroprevalence was 7.8% (95% CI 5.6-10.1). For brucellosis, the RBT showed a prevalence of 5.7% (95% CI 3.8-7.6), and ELISA showed 11.9% (95% CI 9.3-14.6) with a kappa value of 0.53 showing a moderate agreement between the two tests.

Dromedaries are the source of human zoonotic infection. MERS-CoV is enzootic among dromedaries on the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East and in Africa. Over 70% of infected dromedaries are found in Africa. However, all known zoonotic cases of MERS have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula with none being reported in Africa.AimWe aimed to investigate serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection in humans living in camel-herding areas in Morocco to provide insights on whether zoonotic transmission is taking place.MethodsWe carried out a cross sectional seroprevalence study from November 2017 through January 2018. We adapted a generic World Health Organization MERS-CoV questionnaire and protocol to assess demographic and risk factors of infection among a presumed high-risk population. ELISA, MERS-CoV spike pseudoparticle neutralisation tests (ppNT) and plaque neutralisation tests (PRNT) were used to assess MERS-CoV seropositivity.ResultsSerum samples were collected from camel slaughterhouse workers (n?=?137), camel herders (n?=?156) and individuals of the general population without occupational contact with camels but living in camel herding areas (n?=?186). MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies with???90% reduction of plaque numbers were detected in two (1.5%) slaughterhouse workers, none of the camel herders and one individual from the general population (0.5%).ConclusionsThis study provides evidence of zoonotic transmission of MERS-CoV in Morocco in people who have direct or indirect exposure to dromedary camels.",Journal Article,Euro Surveill,24,48,,"Abattoirs;Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Animals;Antibodies, Neutralizing/*blood;Antibodies, Viral/blood;Camelus/*virology;Coronavirus Infections/blood/*diagnosis/epidemiology/transmission;Cross-Sectional Studies;Disease Reservoirs/*veterinary/virology;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Humans;Immunoglobulin G/blood;Middle Aged;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus/genetics/immunology/*isolation &;purification;Morocco/epidemiology;Neutralization Tests;*Occupational Exposure;Occupations;RNA, Viral/genetics/*isolation & purification;Risk Factors;Seroepidemiologic Studies;Zoonoses/*transmission/virology;MERS-CoV;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus;Morocco;dromedaries;transmission;zoonosis",31796154,10.2807/1560-7917.Es.2019.24.48.1900244,1025-496X (Print);1025-496x

Estimating the efficiency and importance of such cross-species transmission using epidemiological approaches is difficult. We therefore addressed this question by studying transmission of low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses from infected ducks to other common animals in a quasi-natural laboratory environment designed to mimic a common barnyard. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) recently infected with H5N2 or H7N3 viruses were introduced into a room housing other mallards plus chickens, blackbirds, rats and pigeons, and transmission was assessed by monitoring virus shedding (ducks) or seroconversion (other species) over the following 4 weeks. Additional animals of each species were directly inoculated with virus to characterize the effect of a known exposure. In both barnyard experiments, virus accumulated to high titers in the shared water pool. The H5N2 virus was transmitted from infected ducks to other ducks and chickens in the room either directly or through environmental contamination, but not to rats or blackbirds. Ducks infected with the H7N2 virus transmitted directly or indirectly to all other species present. Chickens and blackbirds directly inoculated with these viruses shed significant amounts of virus and seroconverted; rats and pigeons developed antiviral antibodies, but, except for one pigeon, failed to shed virus.",Journal Article,PLoS One,6,3,e17643,"Animals;Chickens;Columbidae;Ducks;Influenza A virus/*pathogenicity;Influenza in Birds/*transmission/*virology;Poultry Diseases/virology;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Virus Shedding",21483843,10.1371/journal.pone.0017643,1932-6203

We previously demonstrated HEV genotype 3 infections in pig herds from the highest commercial active region from Argentina. Here, we present a case of acute symptomatic hepatitis E in an elderly man with occupational exposure to pigs who referred regular consumption of pork and sausages. HEV infection in this patient was demonstrated by serological methods, as well as by HEV RNA detection in serum and stool samples using the HEV/MS2 duplex RT-qPCR, formerly optimized in our laboratory. We further detected HEV RNA in pig faeces from the patient?s farm. To confirm the potential role of swine in the transmission, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of all HEV RNA derived from both, the patient and the pig samples. A 303 nt region within the HEV 5 'ORF2 was amplified by nested RT-PCR and subsequently sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains isolated from the farmer and from his pigs presented a nucleotide identity of 100%.

These viruses, referred to as human-like H3N2 viruses, have been known to cause clinical and subclinical infections of swine populations. Due to the paucity and complete unavailability of information on transmission of influenza viruses from other species, especially humans, to swine in Nigeria and Ghana, respectively, this study was designed to investigate the presence and prevalence of a human strain of influenza A (H3N2) in swine populations at three locations in two cities within these two West African countries in January and February, 2014. Using stratified random technique, nasal swab specimens were collected from seventy-five (75) pigs at two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and from fifty (50) pigs in Kumasi, Ghana. These specimens were tested directly by a sensitive Quantitative Solid Phase Antigen-detection Sandwich ELISA using anti-A/Brisbane/10/2007 haemagglutinin monoclonal antibody. Influenza virus A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2) was detected among pigs at the three study locations, with an aggregate prevalence of 4.0% for the two locations in Ibadan, Nigeria and also 4.0% for Kumasi, Ghana. Transmission of influenza viruses from other species to swine portends serious sinister prospects for genetic reassortment and evolvement of novel viruses. We therefore recommend that further studies should be carried out to investigate the presence of other circulating human and avian influenza viruses in swine populations in West Africa and also determine the extent of genetic reassortment of strains circulating among these pigs. This would provide an early warning system for detection of novel influenza viruses, which could have pandemic potentials.",Journal Article,Zoonoses Public Health,63,2,106-11,"Animal Husbandry;Animals;Antigens, Viral/analysis;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Ghana/epidemiology;Humans;Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/immunology/*isolation & purification;Influenza, Human/epidemiology;Nasal Septum/virology;Nigeria/epidemiology;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*epidemiology/*virology;Seasons;Surveys and Questionnaires;Swine;Swine Diseases/*epidemiology/*virology;Zoonoses/epidemiology/virology;Antigenic detection;Ghana;Influenza A (H3N2) virus;Nigeria;human strain",26094828,10.1111/zph.12210,1863-1959

This study was conducted to determine the presence and spatial patterns of this human pandemic virus among Nigerian pigs and identify associated risk factors. Using a two-stage stratified random sampling method, nasal swab specimens were obtained from pigs in Ibadan, Nigeria during the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 influenza seasons, and the virus was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Purified RT-PCR products were sequenced in both directions, and sequences were aligned using MUSCLE. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted in MEGA6. Purely spatial scan statistics and a spatial lag regression model were used to identify spatial clusters and associated risk factors. The virus was detected in both seasons, with an overall prevalence of 8?7%. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the M genes were similar to those of pandemic strains which circulated in humans prior to and during the study. Cluster analysis revealed a significant primary spatial cluster (RR = 4?71, LLR = 5?66, P = 0?0046), while 'hours spent with pigs (R 2 = 0?90, P = 0?0018)' and 'hours spent with pigs from different farms (R 2 = 0?91, P = 0?0001)' were identified as significant risk factors (P < 0?05). These findings reveal that there is considerable risk of transmission of the pandemic virus, either directly from pig handlers or through fomites, to swine herds in Ibadan, Nigeria.

A recent study on the 139 outbreaks detected in Indonesia between 2005 and 2009 found that the type of exposure to sources of H5N1 virus for both the index case and their household members impacted the risk of additional cases in the household. This study describes the disease transmission patterns in those outbreak households. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared cases (n?=?177) and contacts (n?=?496) in the 113 sporadic and 26 cluster outbreaks detected between July 2005 and July 2009 to estimate attack rates and disease intervals. We used final size household models to fit transmission parameters to data on household size, cases and blood-related household contacts to assess the relative contribution of zoonotic and human-to-human transmission of the virus, as well as the reproduction number for human virus transmission. The overall household attack rate was 18.3% and secondary attack rate was 5.5%. Secondary attack rate remained stable as household size increased. The mean interval between onset of subsequent cases in outbreaks was 5.6 days. The transmission model found that human transmission was very rare, with a reproduction number between 0.1 and 0.25, and the upper confidence bounds below 0.4. Transmission model fit was best when the denominator population was restricted to blood-related household contacts of index cases. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The study only found strong support for human transmission of the virus when a single large cluster was included in the transmission model. The reproduction number was well below the threshold for sustained transmission.

The purpose of this study was to identify RVA in nomadic goats and calves during severe diarrhea outbreaks in 2012 and 2014 in Bouaarfa, Morocco, and to characterize the complete genomic constellation of two bovine and caprine strains (S18 and S19) and their genetic relatedness with the human strain ma31 detected in 2011 in Morocco. Partial nucleotide sequencing of VP4 and VP7 genes for the twenty-two positive samples revealed three circulating genotypes: G6P[14], G10P[14], and G10P[5] with predominance of G6P[14] genotype. Full-genome sequencing for both strains S18 and S19 presented, respectively, the following genomic constellations: G6-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 and G10-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3.

D.",2016,Endogenous Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus Identified in a Rodent (Melomys burtoni subsp.) from Wallacea (Indonesia),"Gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) and koala retrovirus (KoRV) most likely originated from a cross-species transmission of an ancestral retrovirus into koalas and gibbons via one or more intermediate as-yet-unknown hosts. A virus highly similar to GALV has been identified in an Australian native rodent (Melomys burtoni) after extensive screening of Australian wildlife. GALV-like viruses have also been discovered in several Southeast Asian species, although screening has not been extensive and viruses discovered to date are only distantly related to GALV. We therefore screened 26 Southeast Asian rodent species for KoRV- and GALV-like sequences, using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing, in the attempt to identify potential GALV and KoRV hosts. Only the individuals belonging to a newly discovered subspecies of Melomys burtoni from Indonesia were positive, yielding an endogenous provirus very closely related to a strain of GALV. The sequence of the critical receptor domain for GALV infection in the Indonesian M. burtoni subsp. was consistent with the susceptibility of the species to GALV infection. The second record of a GALV in M. burtoni provides further evidence that M. burtoni, and potentially other lineages within the widespread subfamily Murinae, may play a role in the spread of GALV-like viruses. The discovery of a GALV in the most western part of the Australo-Papuan distribution of M. burtoni, specifically in a transitional zone between Asia and Australia (Wallacea), may be relevant to the cross-species transmission to gibbons in Southeast Asia and broadens the known distribution of GALVs in wild rodents. IMPORTANCE: Gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) and the koala retrovirus (KoRV) are very closely related, yet their hosts neither are closely related nor overlap geographically. Direct cross-species infection between koalas and gibbons is unlikely. Therefore, GALV and KoRV may have arisen via a cross-species transfer from an intermediate host whose range overlaps those of both gibbons and koalas. Using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing, we have screened a wide range of rodent candidate hosts from Southeast Asia for KoRV- and GALV-like sequences. Only a Melomys burtoni subspecies from Wallacea (Indonesia) was positive for GALV. We report the genome sequence of this newly identified GALV, the critical domain for infection of its potential cellular receptor, and its phylogenetic relationships with the other previously characterized GALVs.

Rodents are important reservoir hosts for many zoonotic pathogens, and rodent population dynamics affect the infection dynamics of rodent-borne diseases, such as diseases caused by hantaviruses. However, the role of rodent population dynamics in determining the infection dynamics of rodent-associated tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria, have gained limited attention in Northern Europe, despite the multiannual abundance fluctuations, the so-called vole cycles, that characterise rodent population dynamics in the region. Here, we quantify the associations between rodent abundance and LB human cases and Puumala Orthohantavirus (PUUV) infections by using two time series (25-year and 9-year) in Finland. Both bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance as well as LB and PUUV infection incidence in humans showed approximately 3-year cycles. Without vector transmitted PUUV infections followed the bank vole host abundance fluctuations with two-month time lag, whereas tick-transmitted LB was associated with bank vole abundance ca. 12 and 24ßmonths earlier. However, the strength of association between LB incidence and bank vole abundance ca. 12ßmonths before varied over the study years.

Bats have been implicated as likely natural reservoir hosts based most recently on an investigation of cases among miners infected in 2007 at the Kitaka mine, Uganda, which contained a large population of Marburg virus-infected Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats. Described here is an ecologic investigation of Python Cave, Uganda, where an American and a Dutch tourist acquired Marburg virus infection in December 2007 and July 2008. More than 40,000 R. aegyptiacus were found in the cave and were the sole bat species present. Between August 2008 and November 2009, 1,622 bats were captured and tested for Marburg virus. Q-RT-PCR analysis of bat liver/spleen tissues indicated ~2.5% of the bats were actively infected, seven of which yielded Marburg virus isolates. Moreover, Q-RT-PCR-positive lung, kidney, colon and reproductive tissues were found, consistent with potential for oral, urine, fecal or sexual transmission. The combined data for R. aegyptiacus tested from Python Cave and Kitaka mine indicate low level horizontal transmission throughout the year. However, Q-RT-PCR data show distinct pulses of virus infection in older juvenile bats (~six months of age) that temporarily coincide with the peak twice-yearly birthing seasons. Retrospective analysis of historical human infections suspected to have been the result of discrete spillover events directly from nature found 83% (54/65) events occurred during these seasonal pulses in virus circulation, perhaps demonstrating periods of increased risk of human infection. The discovery of two tags at Python Cave from bats marked at Kitaka mine, together with the close genetic linkages evident between viruses detected in geographically distant locations, are consistent with R. aegyptiacus bats existing as a large meta-population with associated virus circulation over broad geographic ranges.

Both cases occurred in the same week in May 2013 in paddock mates in south-east Queensland. Australia has been one of only a few countries considered free from rabies-like viruses in domestic animal species. ABLV infection had previously only been confirmed in bats and humans. All three confirmed human cases were fatal, the latest in February 2013. An additional human case of possible abortive infection in 1996 has also been reported. Both equine cases reported here resulted in euthanasia. The risks of infection across other mammalian species are still to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: These two equine cases highlight that ABLV should be considered as a differential diagnosis in animals with similar clinical presentations in Australia. There is a need for greater awareness regarding the zoonotic risk, use of personal protective equipment, pre- and post-exposure prophylactic measures and laboratory diagnostic options. The authors recommend ABLV testing for all Australian cases of progressive equine neurological disease.",Journal Article,Aust Vet J,92,9,324-32,"Animals;DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics;Fatal Outcome;Female;Histocytochemistry/veterinary;Horse Diseases/*virology;Horses;Lyssavirus/genetics/*isolation & purification;Male;Nervous System Diseases/*veterinary/virology;Queensland;Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary;Rhabdoviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology;Zoonoses/*virology;Australian bat lyssavirus;equine encephalitis;equine rabies;zoonoses",25156050,10.1111/avj.12227,0005-0423

Sequence analysis of postmortem samples revealed the presence of an avian H3N8 influenza A virus, similar to a virus circulating in North American waterfowl since at least 2002 but with mutations that indicate recent adaption to mammalian hosts. These include a D701N mutation in the viral PB2 protein, previously reported in highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses infecting people. Lectin staining and agglutination assays indicated the presence of the avian-preferred SA?-2,3 and mammalian SA?-2,6 receptors in seal respiratory tract, and the ability of the virus to agglutinate erythrocytes bearing either the SA?-2,3 or the SA?-2,6 receptor. The emergence of this A/harbor seal/Massachusetts/1/2011 virus may herald the appearance of an H3N8 influenza clade with potential for persistence and cross-species transmission. IMPORTANCE: The emergence of new strains of influenza virus is always of great public concern, especially when the infection of a new mammalian host has the potential to result in a widespread outbreak of disease. Here we report the emergence of an avian influenza virus (H3N8) in New England harbor seals which caused an outbreak of pneumonia and contributed to a U.S. federally recognized unusual mortality event (UME). This outbreak is particularly significant, not only because of the disease it caused in seals but also because the virus has naturally acquired mutations that are known to increase transmissibility and virulence in mammals. Monitoring the spillover and adaptation of avian viruses in mammalian species is critically important if we are to understand the factors that lead to both epizootic and zoonotic emergence.",Journal Article,mBio,3,4,e00166-12,"Animals;Communicable Diseases, Emerging/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Disease Outbreaks;Humans;Influenza A Virus, H3N8 Subtype/classification/genetics/*isolation &;purification/pathogenicity;Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/genetics/isolation & purification;Influenza, Human/virology;Molecular Sequence Data;Mutation;New England/epidemiology;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Phoca/*virology;Phylogeny;Pneumonia/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Viral Proteins/genetics;Virulence",22851656,10.1128/mBio.00166-12,

The virus causes a usually self-limiting liver disease with a mortality rate generally below 1%, although mortality rates of 15%-25% have been recorded in pregnant woman. Chronic infections can also occur. The prevalence of HEV has been extensively studied in wild boars and pigs in northern Italy, where intensive pig herds are predominantly located. In contrast, few data have been collected in south-central Italy, where small pig herds are surrounded by large regional parks populated with heterogeneous wild fauna. In this study, 291 liver samples from wild boars caught in south-central Italy were analysed with the molecular detection of viral RNA. Our results confirm the circulation of HEV in these animals, with a mean prevalence of 13.7% (40 of 291). A nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the HEV strains were highly conserved within the same geographic areas. The wild boar HEV strains belonged to the HEV-3c subtype, which is frequently described in wild boars, and to an uncommon undefined subtype (HEV-3j-like).The viral prevalence detected is concerning because it could represent a potential risk to hunters, meat workers and consumers of wild boar liver and derivative products.

Old World fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) are the natural reservoir hosts. Molecular and serological studies found evidence of henipavirus infection in fruit bats from several African countries. However, little is known about the potential for spillover into domestic animals in East Africa, particularly pigs, which served as amplifying hosts during the first outbreak of NiV in Malaysia and Singapore. We collected sera from 661 pigs presented for slaughter in Uganda between December 2015 and October 2016. Using HeV G and NiV G indirect ELISAs, 14 pigs (2%) were seroreactive in at least one ELISA. Seroprevalence increased to 5.4% in October 2016, when pigs were 9.5 times more likely to be seroreactive than pigs sampled in December 2015 (pß=ß0.04). Eight of the 14 ELISA-positive samples reacted with HeV N antigen in Western blot. None of the sera neutralized HeV or NiV in plaque reduction neutralization tests. Although we did not detect neutralizing antibodies, our results suggest that pigs in Uganda are exposed to henipaviruses or henipa-like viruses. Pigs in this study were sourced from many farms throughout Uganda, suggesting multiple (albeit rare) introductions of henipaviruses into the pig population. We postulate that given the widespread distribution of Old World fruit bats in Africa, spillover of henipaviruses from fruit bats to pigs in Uganda could result in exposure of pigs at multiple locations. A higher risk of a spillover event at the end of the dry season might be explained by higher densities of bats and contact with pigs at this time of the year, exacerbated by nutritional stress in bat populations and their reproductive cycle. Future studies should prioritize determining the risk of spillover of henipaviruses from pigs to people, so that potential risks can be mitigated.",Journal Article,Transbound Emerg Dis,66,2,921-928,Animals;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Female;Hendra Virus/*isolation & purification;Henipavirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Male;Nipah Virus/*isolation & purification;Prevalence;Risk Factors;Seroepidemiologic Studies;Sus scrofa;Swine;Swine Diseases/*epidemiology/virology;Uganda/epidemiology;Hendra virus;Henipavirus;Nipah virus;Uganda;antibodies,30576076,10.1111/tbed.13105,1865-1674 (Print);1865-1674

OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential for zoonotic influenza transmission, the current study looked for serologic evidence of H2 influenza infection among workers at two swine facilities, some exposed and some unexposed to H2N3-positive pigs. METHODS: The sera were assessed for antibodies to swine H2 influenza and currently circulating seasonal human influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. Workers were interviewed to obtain details such as age, influenza vaccination history, experiences of influenza-like-illness, and use of personal protective equipment and hygiene when working with pigs. Exposure and risk factors for positive antibody titers were compared for exposed and unexposed individuals as well as for H2 antibody-positive and H2 antibody-negative individuals. RESULTS: Blood was taken from 27 swine workers, of whom four had positive H2 antibody titers (> or = 1:40). Three of the positive employees were born before 1968 and one had an unknown birth date. Only one of these workers had been exposed to H2N3-positive pigs, and he was born in 1949.

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences, which included comparison with other rabies strains recovered from throughout the Americas, identified three main groups of Brazilian viruses, arbitrarily designated BRL-1 to BRL-3. BRL-1 was found in terrestrial carnivores and clusters with other American strains of the cosmopolitan lineage. BRL-2 comprised two distinct isolates, recovered from two species of non-haematophagous bats, that had evolutionary links to insectivorous-bat-derived strains of North America. BRL-3 consisted of isolates from vampire bats and from livestock species probably infected via contact with vampire bats. The terrestrial group was further subdivided into three subtypes: BRL-1a was associated exclusively with dogs and cats, while BRL-1b and BRL-1c were found exclusively in hoary foxes. These observations strongly support the role of the Brazilian hoary fox as a rabies reservoir.

Evidence suggests that human exposure and infections with hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes (GT) 3 and 4 results from zoonotic transmission. Hypothesising that HEV GT3 and GT4 are circulating in the Vietnamese pig population and can be transmitted to humans, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of HEV exposure in a population of farmers and the general population. We additionally performed sequence analysis of HEV in pig populations in the same region to address knowledge gaps regarding HEV circulation and to evaluate if pigs were a potential source of HEV exposure. We found a high prevalence of HEV GT3 viral RNA in pigs (19.1% in faecal samples and 8.2% in rectal swabs) and a high HEV seroprevalence in pig farmers (16.0%) and a hospital-attending population (31.7%) in southern Vietnam. The hospital population was recruited as a general-population proxy even though this particular population subgroup may introduce bias.

This study aimed at getting better knowledge on SFV transmission dynamics, risk factors for such a zoonotic infection and, searching for intra-familial dissemination and the level of peripheral blood (pro)viral loads in infected individuals. We studied 1,321 people from the general adult population (mean age 49 yrs, 640 women and 681 men) and 198 individuals, mostly men, all of whom had encountered a NHP with a resulting bite or scratch. All of these, either Pygmies (436) or Bantus (1085) live in villages in South Cameroon. A specific SFV Western blot was used and two nested PCRs (polymerase, and LTR) were done on all the positive/borderline samples by serology. In the general population, 2/1,321 (0.2%) persons were found to be infected. In the second group, 37/198 (18.6%) persons were SFV positive.

The viral origin of the amplified sequences matched with the history reported by the hunters, most of which (83%) are aged 20 to 40 years and acquired the infection during the last twenty years. The (pro)viral load in 33 individuals infected by a gorilla FV was quite low (<1 to 145 copies per 10(5) cells) in the peripheral blood leucocytes. Of the 30 wives and 12 children from families of FV infected persons, only one woman was seropositive in WB without subsequent viral DNA amplification.

Pumas, bobcats, and domestic cats are sympatric in many areas of North America and share many of the same pathogens, some of which are zoonotic. We analyzed bobcat, puma, and feral domestic cat samples collected from targeted geographic areas. We examined exposure to three pathogens that are taxonomically diverse (bacterial, protozoal, viral), that incorporate multiple transmission strategies (vector-borne, environmental exposure/ingestion, and direct contact), and that vary in species-specificity. Bartonella spp., Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), and Toxoplasma gondii IgG were detected in all three species with mean respective prevalence as follows: puma 16%, 41% and 75%; bobcat 31%, 22% and 43%; domestic cat 45%, 10% and 1%. Bartonella spp. were highly prevalent among domestic cats in Southern California compared to other cohort groups. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus exposure was primarily associated with species and age, and was not influenced by geographic location. Pumas were more likely to be infected with FIV than bobcats, with domestic cats having the lowest infection rate. Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence was high in both pumas and bobcats across all sites; in contrast, few domestic cats were seropositive, despite the fact that feral, free ranging domestic cats were targeted in this study. Interestingly, a directly transmitted species-specific disease (FIV) was not associated with geographic location, while exposure to indirectly transmitted diseases--vector-borne for Bartonella spp. and ingestion of oocysts via infected prey or environmental exposure for T. gondii--varied significantly by site. Pathogens transmitted by direct contact may be more dependent upon individual behaviors and intra-specific encounters.

From the patas monkeys, virus isolation was generally not possible, but from one animal that was ill a virus designated pamG31 was amplified by PCR. In addition, for the two SIVagm isolates, an 830 bp region spanning the env and nef genes was amplified and sequenced. Comparisons of sequences from the env/nef region revealed 80% identity between pam G31 and SIVagm isolates from AGMs of the sabaeus subspecies, and 94% identity between the two SIVagm isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that pamG31 belongs to the SIVagm sabaeus subgroup. This is the first report of a lentiviral infection in a patas monkey. The close genetic relatedness between pamG31 and SIVagm sabaeus viruses is a strong argument in favour of cross-species transmission of SIV between AGMs and patas monkeys in the wild.

The Uganda Ministry of Health received alerts of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in humans from Kiruhura, Buikwe, Kiboga, and Mityana districts. Laboratory results from Uganda Virus Research Institute indicated that human cases were positive for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) by polymerase chain reaction. We investigated to determine the scope of outbreaks, identify exposure factors, and recommend evidence-based control and prevention measures. METHODS: A suspected case was defined as a person with acute fever onset, negative malaria test result, and at least two of the following symptoms: headache, muscle or joint pain, bleeding, and any gastroenteritis symptom (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea) in a resident of Kiruhura, Buikwe, Mityana, and Kiboga districts from 1(st) October 2017 to 30(th) January 2018. A confirmed case was defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation by either detection of RVF nucleic acid by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or demonstration of serum IgM or IgG antibodies by ELISA. Community case finding was conducted in all affected districts. In-depth interviews were conducted with human cases that were infected with RVF who included herdsmen and slaughterers/meat handlers to identify exposure factors for RVF infection. A total of 24 human and 362 animal blood samples were tested. Animal blood samples were purposively collected from farms that had reported stormy abortions in livestock and unexplained death of animals after a short illness (107 cattle, 83 goats, and 43 sheep). Convenient sampling for the wildlife (10 zebras, 1 topi, and 1 impala) was conducted to investigate infection in animals from Kiruhura, Buikwe, Mityana, and Kiboga districts. Human blood was tested for anti-RVFV IgM and IgG and animal blood for anti-RVFV IgG. Environmental assessments were conducted during the outbreaks in all the affected districts. RESULTS: Sporadic RVF outbreaks occurred from mid-October 2017 to mid-January 2018 affecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Human cases were reported from Kiruhura, Buikwe, Kiboga, and Mityana districts. Of the 24 human blood samples tested, anti-RVFV IgG was detected in 7 (29%) human samples; 1 human sample had detectable IgM only, and 6 had both IgM and IgG. Three of the seven confirmed human cases died among humans. Results from testing animal blood samples obtained from Kiruhura district indicated that 44% (64/146) cattle, 46% (35/76) goats, and 45% (9/20) sheep tested positive for RVF. Among wildlife, (1/10) zebras, (1/1) topi, and (1/1) impala tested positive for RVFV by serological tests. One blood sample from sheep in Kiboga district tested RVFV positive. All the human cases were exposed through contact or consumption of meat from infected animals.

Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) exhibit a high seroprevalence for WNV in urban settings where high virus circulation and human spillover have been reported. In Atlanta, Georgia, human cases of WNV are uncommon despite high infection rates in birds and mosquitoes. In this study, we evaluated WNV exposure of eastern gray squirrels in a WNV hot spot in Atlanta. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gray squirrels were live-trapped in Grant Park, Atlanta, during July-October, 2012, and a census was conducted to estimate squirrel density in the study site. Sera from trapped animals were tested for circulating virus-by-virus isolation in cell culture and for WNV-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plaque reduction neutralization test. Mosquitoes were collected at the same location and tested for virus isolation. RESULTS: Among the 69 collected squirrels, 25 (36.2%) tested positive for WNV antibodies, although none were viremic. Seroprevalence was lower in juveniles (18.8%) than in adults (37.5%), but this difference was not statistically significant. Gender and squirrel density had no effect on seroprevalence. Seasonality of squirrel seroprevalence and of mosquito infection were significantly associated, both peaking in August. No difference in squirrel exposure was detected across the collection sites. CONCLUSIONS: We report a high degree of WNV exposure in squirrels in Grant Park that was correlated with seasonality of mosquito infection. The detection of antibodies in juveniles suggests that circulation of WNV in the surveyed population is ongoing.

In Germany, about 250 human cases are registered annually, with the highest incidence reported in the last years coming from the federal states Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg. In veterinary medicine, only sporadic cases in wild and domestic animals have been reported; however, a high number of wild and domestic animals have tested positive for the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) antibody. CASE PRESENTATION: In May 2015, a five-month-old lamb from a farm with 15 Merino Land sheep and offspring in Nersingen/Bavaria, a TBEV risk area, showed impaired general health with pyrexia and acute neurological signs. The sheep suffered from ataxia, torticollis, tremor, nystagmus, salivation and finally somnolence with inappetence and recumbency. After euthanasia, pathological, histopathological, immunohistochemical, bacteriological, parasitological and virological analyses were performed. Additionally, blood samples from the remaining, healthy sheep in the herd were taken for detection of TBEV antibody titres. At necropsy and accompanying parasitology, the sheep showed a moderate to severe infection with Trichostrongylids, Moniezia and Eimeria species. Histopathology revealed mild to moderate necrotising, lymphohistiocytic and granulocytic meningoencephalitis with gliosis and neuronophagia. Immunohistochemistry for TBEV was negative. RNA of a TBEV strain, closely related to the Kumlinge A52 strain, was detected in the brain by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and subsequent PCR product sequencing.

HEV comprises four genotypes with different geographic distributions and host ranges. We utilize this natural case-control study for investigating the evolution of zoonotic viruses compared to single-host viruses, using 244 near-full-length HEV genomes. Genome-wide estimates of the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous evolutionary changes (dN/dS ratio) located a region of overlapping reading frames, which is subject to positive selection in genotypes 3 and 4. The open reading frames (ORFs) involved have functions related to host-pathogen interaction, so genotype-specific evolution of these regions may reflect their fitness. Bayesian inference of evolutionary rates shows that genotypes 3 and 4 have significantly higher rates than genotype 1 across all ORFs. Reconstruction of the phylogenies of zoonotic genotypes demonstrates significant intermingling of isolates between hosts. We speculate that the genotype-specific differences may result from cyclical adaptation to different hosts in genotypes 3 and 4.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is increasingly recognized as a pathogen that affects both the developing and the developed world. While most often clinically mild, HEV can be severe or fatal in certain demographics, such as expectant mothers. Like many other viral pathogens, HEV has been classified into several distinct genotypes. We show that most of the HEV genome is evolutionarily constrained. One locus of positive selection is unusual in that it encodes two distinct protein products. We are the first to detect positive selection in this overlap region.

Skunks (Mephitis mephitis) are a reservoir of skunk strain rabies virus in Canada, with the exception of some areas including the province of British Columbia (BC). Beyond rabies, the reservoir status of skunks for emerging and zoonotic pathogens in BC is unknown. From March 2011 to February 2015, 50 free-ranging skunks were necropsied and tested for 4 pathogens: influenza A, Aleutian disease virus (ADV), Leptospira spp. and Salmonella spp. Two skunks (4%) with respiratory disease caused by influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 were detected during the human flu season suggesting that skunks may represent a target population for reverse zoonosis of this strain of influenza A virus. High prevalence of ADV infection was detected (43/50, 86%). Two of the infected skunks exhibited Aleutian disease (AD) suggesting that skunks act as both a reservoir and a target population for the virus. Most studies of ADV have focused on the potential for infection of free-ranging species living near mink farms. Our study suggests that urban skunks may be a primary host for the virus independent of domestic mink. Whether skunks act as a reservoir of ADV infection for other peridomestic species will depend on host specificity of the viral strains. Leptospira interrogans was detected in 18% (9/49) of the skunks. Identification of the serovar(s) detected is needed to determine any public health risk of leptospirosis following exposure to infected skunks. Salmonella spp. was isolated from three of 43 skunks (7%), specifically S. Typhimurium, S. Muenchen and S. Enteritidis.

Following the intramuscular challenge, 75% of the animals infected with EBLV-1 and 100% of those that were challenged with EBLV-2 developed clinical signs of rabies and then recovered during the 94-day observation period. Disease pathogenesis also varied substantially between the two viruses. Infection with EBLV-1 resulted in peracute clinical signs, which are suggestive of motor neuron involvement. Antibody induction was observed and substantial inflammatrory infiltrate in the brain. In contrast, more antigen was detected in the EBLV-2-infected sheep brains but less inflammatory infiltrate and no virus neutralising antibody was evident. The latter involved a more protracted disease that was behaviour orientated.

78,Jonny,NO,418,"Brown, I. H.",2000,The epidemiology and evolution of influenza viruses in pigs,"Pigs serve as major reservoirs of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses which are endemic in pig populations world-wide and are responsible for one of the most prevalent respiratory diseases in pigs. The maintenance of these viruses in pigs and the frequent exchange of viruses between pigs and other species is facilitated directly by swine husbandry practices, which provide for a continual supply of susceptible pigs and regular contact with other species, particularly humans. The pig has been a contender for the role of intermediate host for reassortment of influenza A viruses of avian and human origin since it is the only domesticated mammalian species which is reared in abundance and is susceptible to, and allows productive replication, of avian and human influenza viruses. This can lead to the generation of new strains of influenza, some of which may be transmitted to other species including humans. This concept is supported by the detection of human-avian reassortant viruses in European pigs with some evidence for subsequent transmission to the human population. Following interspecies transmission to pigs, some influenza viruses may be extremely unstable genetically, giving rise to variants which could be conducive to the species barrier being breached a second time. Eventually, a stable lineage derived from the dominant variant may become established in pigs. Genetic drift occurs particularly in the genes encoding the external glycoproteins, but does not usually result in the same antigenic variability that occurs in the prevailing strains in the human population. Adaptation of a 'newly' transmitted influenza virus to pigs can take many years. Both human H3N2 and avian H1N1 were detected in pigs many years before they acquired the ability to spread rapidly and become associated with disease epidemics in pigs.",Journal Article,Vet Microbiol,74,01-Feb,29-46,"Animals;*Evolution, Molecular;Genetic Variation;Humans;Orthomyxoviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary;Swine;Swine Diseases/*virology;Turkeys;Zoonoses/*transmission/virology",10799776,10.1016/s0378-1135(00)00164-4,0378-1135 (Print);0378-1135

Clinical signs included lymphadenopathy, anemia, septicemia, and weight loss; 5 panthers died. Not associated with FeLV outcome were the genetic heritage of the panthers (pure Florida vs. Texas/Florida crosses) and co-infection with feline immunodeficiency virus. Genetic analysis of panther FeLV, designated FeLV-Pco, determined that the outbreak likely came from 1 cross-species transmission from a domestic cat. The FeLV-Pco virus was closely related to the domestic cat exogenous FeLV-A subgroup in lacking recombinant segments derived from endogenous FeLV. FeLV-Pco sequences were most similar to the well-characterized FeLV-945 strain, which is highly virulent and strongly pathogenic in domestic cats because of unique long terminal repeat and envelope sequences.

In this study, we collected rectal swabs from a total of 1,498 cattle, sheep and goats. BCoV detection was based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Sanger sequencing of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region for postive samples were done and nucleotide sequences were compared with homologous sequences from the GenBank.

The Burmese python has caused a dramatic decrease in mammal diversity in southern Florida, which has shifted vector host use towards EVEV amplifying hosts (rodents), resulting in an indirect increase in EVEV infection prevalence in vector mosquitoes, putatively elevating human transmission risk.

This wild ungulate shares habitat and resources with other potential HEV carriers in Iberian Mediterranean ecosystems, although information about the role of such sympatric species in the HEV epidemiological cycle is still very limited. The aims of the present large-scale, long-term study were: (1) to determine the seroprevalence and prevalence of HEV in both free-living and captive populations of the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus), the most endangered felid in the world; (2) to determine potential risk factors associated with HEV exposure in this species and (3) to evaluate the dynamics of seropositivity in longitudinally sampled animals during the study period. Between 2010 and 2021, serum samples from 275 Iberian lynxes were collected in free-ranging and captive populations across the Iberian Peninsula. Forty-four of the 275 lynxes were also longitudinally sampled during the study period. A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was used to test for the presence of antibodies against HEV. A subset of seropositive samples was analysed by Western blot (WB) assay to confirm exposure to HEV. In addition, serum, liver and/or faecal samples from 367 individuals were tested for orthohepevirus RNA by RT-PCR. A total of 50 (18.2%; 95% CI: 14.1-23.2) of the 275 animals analysed had anti-HEV antibodies by ELISA. Exposure to HEV was confirmed by WB in most of the ELISA-positive Iberian lynxes analysed. Significantly higher seroprevalence was found in captive (33.6%) compared to free-ranging (7.4%) individuals. Within captive population, the GEE model identified 'age' (senile, adult and subadult) as risk a factor potentially associated with HEV exposure in the Iberian lynx. Thirteen (29.5%) of 44 longitudinally surveyed individuals seroconverted against HEV during the study period. HEV RNA was detected in the faeces of one (1/364; 0.3%; 95% CI: 0.0-0.8) free-ranging adult animal sampled in 2021. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequenced strain belongs to HEV-3f subtype and shared a high nucleotide sequence identity (97-99.6%) with human HEV-3f sequences from Spain and France. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first survey study on HEV in the Iberian lynx and the first molecular report of HEV-A infection in free-ranging felines. Our results indicate high exposure to HEV-3 in Iberian lynx populations, particularly those kept in captivity. The serological results suggest widespread but not homogeneous circulation of HEV in Iberian lynx populations.

Understanding the VSBV-1 epidemiology is crucial to develop, implement, and maintain surveillance strategies for the detection and control of animal and human infections. Based on a newly detected human encephalitis case in a zoological garden, epidemiological squirrel trade investigations and molecular phylogeny analyses of VSBV-1 with temporal and spatial resolution were conducted. Phylogenetic analyses indicated a recent emergence of VSBV-1 in European squirrel holdings and several animal-animal and animal-human spill-over infections. Virus phylogeny linked to squirrel trade analysis showed the introduction of a common ancestor of the known current VSBV-1 isolates into captive exotic squirrels in Germany, most likely by Prevost's squirrels (Callosciurus prevostii). The links of the animal trade between private breeders and zoos, the likely introduction pathway of VSBV-1 into Germany, and the role of a primary animal distributor were elucidated. In addition, a seroprevalence study was performed among zoo animal caretakers from VSBV-1 affected zoos. No seropositive healthy zoo animal caretakers were found, underlining a probable high-case fatality rate of human VSBV-1 infections.

With 31% of United Kingdom households owning a dog, this could prove to be an important transmission route. To examine this risk, canine tissues were studied for their ability to bind to HuNoV in vitro. In addition, canine stool samples were analyzed for the presence of viral nucleic acid, and canine serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-HuNoV antibodies. The results showed that seven different genotypes of HuNoV virus-like particles (VLPs) can bind to canine gastrointestinal tissue, suggesting that infection is at least theoretically possible. Although HuNoV RNA was not identified in stool samples from 248 dogs, serological evidence of previous exposure to HuNoV was obtained in 43/325 canine serum samples. Remarkably, canine seroprevalence for different HuNoV genotypes mirrored the seroprevalence in the human population. Though entry and replication within cells have not been demonstrated, the canine serological data indicate that dogs produce an immune response to HuNoV, implying productive infection.

Both viruses have simian counterparts (STLV-1 and STLV-2). STLV-3 belongs to a third group of lymphotropic viruses which infect numerous African monkeys species. Among 240 Cameroonian plasma tested for the presence of HTLV-1 and/or HTLV-2 antibodies, 48 scored positive by immunofluorescence. Among those, 27 had indeterminate western-blot pattern. PCR amplification of pol and tax regions, using HTLV-1, -2 and STLV-3 highly conserved primers, demonstrated the presence of a new human retrovirus in one DNA sample. tax (180 bp) and pol (318 bp) phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the strong relationships between the novel human strain (Pyl43) and STLV-3 isolates from Cameroon. The virus, that we tentatively named HTLV-3, originated from a 62 years old Bakola Pygmy living in a remote settlement in the rain forest of Southern Cameroon. The plasma was reactive on MT2 cells but was negative on C19 cells. The HTLV 2.4 western-blot exhibited a strong reactivity to p19 and a faint one to MTA-1. On the INNO-LIA strip, it reacted faintly with the generic p19 (I/II), but strongly to the generic gp46 (I/II) and to the specific HTLV-2 gp46. The molecular relationships between Pyl43 and STLV-3 are thus not paralleled by the serological results, as most of the STLV-3 infected monkeys have an ""HTLV-2 like"" WB pattern. In the context of the multiple interspecies transmissions which occurred in the past, and led to the present-day distribution of the PTLV-1, it is thus very tempting to speculate that this newly discovered human retrovirus HTLV-3 might be widespread, at least in the African continent.",Journal Article,Retrovirology,2,,30,"Animals;Blotting, Western;Cameroon;Cell Line;DNA, Viral/blood;Deltaretrovirus/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Deltaretrovirus Infections/virology;Gene Products, pol/genetics;Gene Products, tax/genetics;Humans;Middle Aged;Molecular Sequence Data;Phylogeny;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Primate T-lymphotropic virus 3;Sequence Analysis, DNA",15882466,10.1186/1742-4690-2-30,1742-4690

However, so far the direct precursor of influenza viruses from domestic birds has never been identified.

The wild and domestic avian strains appeared strictly related at both phenotypic and genetic level: homology percentages in seven of their genes were comprised between 99.8% (for PB2) and 99.1% (for M), and their NA genes differed mainly because of a 23-aminoacid deletion in the NA stalk. Outside this region of the molecule, the NAs of the two virus groups showed 99% similarity.

We combined research on: bat ecology (reproductive phenology, population dynamics and diet); human practices and perceptions (ethnographic research and a knowledge, attitude and practice study); and Nipah virus circulation in bat and human populations (virus monitoring in bat urine and anti-Nipah-virus antibody detection in human serum). FINDINGS: Our results confirmed circulation of Nipah virus in fruit bats (28 of 3930 urine samples positive by polymerase chain reaction testing). We identified clear potential routes for virus transmission to humans through local practices, including fruit consumed by bats and harvested by humans when Nipah virus is circulating, and palm juice production. Nevertheless, in the serological survey of 418 potentially exposed people, none of them were seropositive to Nipah virus. Differences in agricultural practices among the regions where Nipah virus has emerged may explain the situation in Cambodia and point to actions to limit the risks of virus transmission to humans. CONCLUSION: Human practices are key to understanding transmission risks associated with emerging infectious diseases.

FIV-Pco pol gene sequences isolated from pumas revealed extensive sequence diversity, greater than has been documented in the domestic cat. The puma sequences formed two highly divergent groups, analogous to the clades which have been defined for domestic cat and lion (Panthera leo) FIV. The puma clade A was made up of samples from Florida and California, whereas clade B consisted of samples from other parts of North America, Central America, and Brazil. The difference between these two groups was as great as that reported among three lion FIV clades. Within puma clades, sequence variation is large, comparable to between-clade differences seen for domestic cat clades, allowing recognition of 15 phylogenetic lineages (subclades) among puma FIV-Pco. Large sequence divergence among isolates, nearly complete species monophyly, and widespread geographic distribution suggest that FIV-Pco has evolved within the puma species for a long period. The sequence data provided evidence for vertical transmission of FIV-Pco from mothers to their kittens, for coinfection of individuals by two different viral strains, and for cross-species transmission of FIV from a domestic cat to a puma.

More recently, serological analysis demonstrated that these two viruses continue to circulate on the Island in several domesticated and wild animals. Here, we detected the seroconversion to SSHV in wild snowshoe hares and in a single sentinel rabbit. The seroconversion in the sentinel rabbit occurred in early August (2011), which corresponded to the weeks of peak mosquito collections and the timing of the detection of SSHV in suspected mosquito vectors.

The incubation period is between 8 and 43 days. The main prodromal symptoms are: myalgias, fever, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, dyspnoea, petechiae and coughing. After the 4th day pulmonary oedema, hypotension and renal failure appear. Haemorrhagic disorders may occur. The first laboratory tests presenting alterations are: haemoconcentration, leukocytosis, low platelet count <150 micro/L, and presence of immunoblasts. The treatment is supportive: mechanical ventilation, vasopressor drugs, haemofiltration or haemodialysis, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. There is no specific treatment for HPS. Preventive measures must be empathised. CONCLUSION: The principal risk factors for tourists are: accommodation in abandoned or closed up facilities; failure to use indicated pathways when walking in forests; camping outside recommended areas; drinking water from natural sources and fishing in risk areas. The risk of infection for foreign tourists in Chile is low.",Journal Article,Travel Med Infect Dis,5,1,30-Apr,Animals;Chile/epidemiology;Disease Reservoirs/veterinary;Hantavirus/pathogenicity;Hantavirus Infections/*epidemiology/transmission;Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome/*epidemiology/transmission;Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome/*epidemiology/transmission;Humans;Retrospective Studies;Risk Factors;Rodent Diseases/epidemiology/transmission;Rodentia;*Travel;*Zoonoses,17161316,10.1016/j.tmaid.2006.02.002,1477-8939 (Print);1477-8939

The close proximity of humans to animals may foster cross-species infection resulting in the emergence of novel/unusual strains by genetic reassortment. In this study, we characterized 500 diarrhoeal samples for group A rotaviruses (RVA) from children (n = 290), piglets (n = 95) and calves (n = 115) in Northeast India during 2012-2013. The data showed that 142/500 (28?4%) faecal samples were positive for RVA with the highest level of infection detected in piglets (57/142, 40?1%) followed by children (51/142, 35?9%) and calves (34/142, 23?9%). Sequence-based G- and P-typing showed G1P[8] (25%) and G1P[7] (35%) were the prevailing genotypes in both humans and animals. Single cases of unusual genotypes, i.e. G9P[8], G5P[8] in humans and G1P[13], G1P[23] and G3P[7] in animals were also identified. Cluster analyses of the sequences showed regional strains were genetically closer to their homologous strains. However, human G5P[8] and porcine G1P[8] strains showed homology to heterologous hosts of their prototype strains. The subsequent global spread of unusual RV strains may result in their establishment over time, presenting challenges to future vaccine evaluation programmes. More studies on emerging genotypes are required to elucidate how RVA strains evolve post-vaccination.

A comprehensive assessment of the seroprevalence of A(H5N1) virus antibodies remains a gap and limits understanding of the true risk of A(H5N1) virus infection. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published serosurveys to assess the risk of subclinical and clinically mild A(H5N1) virus infections. We assessed A(H5N1) virus antibody titers and changes in titers among populations with variable exposures to different A(H5N1) viruses. RESULTS: Across studies using the World Health Organization-recommended seropositive definition, the point estimates of the seroprevalence of A(H5N1) virus-specific antibodies were higher in poultry-exposed populations (range 0-0.6%) and persons exposed to both human A(H5N1) cases and infected birds (range 0.4-1.8%) than in close contacts of A(H5N1) cases or the general population (none to very low frequencies). Seroprevalence was higher in persons exposed to A(H5N1) clade 0 virus (1.9%, range 0.7-3.2%) than in participants exposed to other clades of A(H5N1) virus (range 0-0.5%) (pß<?0.05). Seroprevalence was higher in poultry-exposed populations (range 0-1.9%) if such studies utilized antigenically similar A(H5N1) virus antigens in assays to A(H5N1) viruses circulating among poultry.

We report the clinical and microbiological features of patients infected with influenza A H7N9 virus and compare genomic features of the human virus with those of the virus in market poultry in Zhejiang, China. METHODS: Between March 7 and April 8, 2013, we included hospital inpatients if they had new-onset respiratory symptoms, unexplained radiographic infiltrate, and laboratory-confirmed H7N9 virus infection. We recorded histories and results of haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We took throat and sputum samples, used RT-PCR to detect M, H7, and N9 genes, and cultured samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. We tested for co-infections and monitored serum concentrations of six cytokines and chemokines. We collected cloacal swabs from 86 birds from epidemiologically linked wet markets and inoculated embryonated chicken eggs with the samples. We identified and subtyped isolates by RT-PCR sequencing. RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and PCR sequencing were done for one human and one chicken isolate. We characterised and phylogenetically analysed the eight gene segments of the viruses in the patient's and the chicken's isolates, and constructed phylogenetic trees of H, N, PB2, and NS genes. FINDINGS: We identified four patients (mean age 56 years), all of whom had contact with poultry 3-8 days before disease onset. They presented with fever and rapidly progressive pneumonia that did not respond to antibiotics. Patients were leucopenic and lymphopenic, and had impaired liver or renal function, substantially increased serum cytokine or chemokine concentrations, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with disease progression. Two patients died. Sputum specimens were more likely to test positive for the H7N9 virus than were samples from throat swabs. The viral isolate from the patient was closely similar to that from an epidemiologically linked market chicken. All viral gene segments were of avian origin. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. We noted Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 (associated with increased affinity for ?-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors) and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation (associated with mammalian adaptation). Ser31Asn mutation, which is associated with adamantane resistance, was noted in viral M2. INTERPRETATION: Cross species poultry-to-person transmission of this new reassortant H7N9 virus is associated with severe pneumonia and multiorgan dysfunction in human beings. Monitoring of the viral evolution and further study of disease pathogenesis will improve disease management, epidemic control, and pandemic preparedness.

Rotavirus infection in neonatal calves causes major problems in the livestock industry. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and genetic diversity of bovine rotavirus (BoRVA) infections in calves with diarrhea and to perform whole genome analysis of an unusual strain, designated as RVA/Calf-wt/KOR/KNU-GJ2/2020/G5P[7], that was detected in a 2-day-old diarrheic calf. From 459 diarrheic calves aged 1-40ßdays, fecal samples were collected and BoRVA infections were screened using real-time RT-PCR targeting VP6 gene. BoRVA was detected in 195 (42.4%) samples and was most prevalent in calves aged 1-10ßdays (47.2%). No significant difference in the BoRVA infection rate was observed between calves born in herds that were (42.1%) and were not (42.6%) vaccinated against BoRVA. A binomial regression analysis revealed that calves aged 1-10ßdays (95% confidence intervals [CI]:1.18-24.34; Pß=ß0.000) and 11-20ßdays (95% CI: 0.76-16.83, Pß=ß0.000) had a 5.37- and 3.58-fold higher BoRVA prevalence in comparison to those aged 31-40ßdays, respectively. The RVA-positive samples were subsequently subjected to amplification of the VP7 and VP4 genes for determining G and P genotypes. Overall, 45 (23.1%, 45/195) and 63 (32.3, 63/195) sequences for VP7 and VP4 were obtained. In this study, four G and three P genotypes were identified. G6 (86.7%) was the most prevalent genotype, followed by G8 (8.9%), G10 (2.2%), and G5 (2.2%). P[5] (92.1%) was the most frequently detected, followed by P[11] (6.3%), and P[7] (1.6%). The G6P[5] (82.2%) is the most common combination found in Korean native calves with diarrhea, whereas G6P[11] (4.4%) and G10P[11] (2.2%) had relatively low prevalence. G8P[5] (8.9%) was identified for the first time in diarrheic calves in the KOR.

Antibody prevalence in grizzly bears was 0% for parvovirus, 8.3% (40/480) for distemper, 14% (68/480) for infectious hepatitis, 16.5% (79/480) for brucellosis, 19% (93/480) for tularaemia and 47% (225/478) for trichinellosis. In black bears, prevalence ranged from 0% for distemper and parvovirus to 27.5% for trichinellosis and 32% for tularaemia. Antibody prevalence for brucellosis (2.5%) and tularaemia (32%) were identical for grizzly bears and black bears from the geographical area of interior Alaska. Links between differences in prevalence and the origin of the grizzly bears were observed. Antibodies to canine distemper virus and infectious hepatitis virus were mainly detected in grizzly bears from Kodiak Island and the Alaskan Peninsula. Brucellosis antibodies were prevalent in grizzly bears from western and northern Alaska, whereas tularaemia antibodies were detected in grizzly bears from interior Alaska and the Arctic.

Due to segmented nature of dsRNA genome and wide host range, vast genetic and antigenic diversity exists amongst different isolates of rotaviruses. A total of 230 fecal ovine and caprine samples collected from organized farms and villages in Haryana were screened for rotavirus detection. Samples were screened by latex agglutination test and RNA-PAGE followed by RT-PCR and nucleic acid sequencing. The latex agglutination test showed 25 newborn lamb and 4 kid fecal samples positive for rotavirus. However, RNA-PAGE showed only 9 lamb fecal samples positive for rotavirus. All the samples were subjected to RT-PCR employing vp4 and vp7 gene specific primers of group A rotavirus of ovine, bovine and human origin. Only two samples from lamb (Sheep18/Hisar/2013 and Sheep22/Hisar/2013) showed vp4 and vp7 gene specific amplification with human group A rotavirus (GAR) specific primer. However, they did not show any amplification with ovine and bovine rotavirus specific primers. The nucleotide as well as deduced amino acid sequence analysis of vp4 gene of these isolates showed >98/97% and vp7 gene >95/94% nt/aa identity with human GAR from different regions of the world. Based on nucleotide similarity search, Sheep18/Hisar/2013 and Sheep22/Hisar/2013 isolates were genotyped as G1P[8] and G1P[4].

SFTS is caused by the SFTS virus, a novel phlebovirus, and is spread by ticks. Methods: A 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaint of fever and was diagnosed with confirmed SFTS. An epidemiological investigation was conducted, and immunofluorescent antibody assays (IFAs) were performed to determine the role of the patient's three dogs in the transmission. PCR assays were performed using ticks that were collected with the dragging and flagging method from the patient's dogs and home. Results: PCR results were positive, and IFA confirmed an increased antibody titer. Although the reverse transcription PCR results of the three dogs were negative for SFTS virus, one dog had an elevated SFTS IFA immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer of 1:1,024. Moreover, a number of ticks were observed in the area surrounding the dog cages. Based on the findings of the patient interview, the patient was likely to have acquired SFTS by blood splash because he removed or burst ticks from the dogs with his bare hands. Although no tick bites were reported, tick transmission could not be ruled out. Studies have shown that only one in three individuals with a diagnosis of SFTS recalls a tick bite; thus, a definite exclusion of tick transmission in this case was not possible. Conclusions: The epidemiological findings of our case suggest a possible relationship between tick infestation in domestic dogs and SFTS virus transmission to humans. However, there is no direct evidence supporting this viral transmission route. Future studies are needed to further investigate a potential route of SFTS transmission by exposure to engorged tick blood or pet dogs.",Journal Article,Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis,20,4,285-294,"Animals;Communicable Diseases, Emerging/virology;Dog Diseases/*parasitology/therapy;Dogs;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Pest Control/*methods;Phlebovirus/isolation & purification;Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome/*etiology;Tick Bites/veterinary;Ticks/virology;*Zoonoses;*phlebovirus;*severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome;*tick-borne diseases;*ticks",32045336,10.1089/vbz.2019.2463,1530-3667

While some reverse zoonotic-origin viruses adapt and become enzootic in swine, nascent reverse zoonoses may result in virus detections that are difficult to classify as ""swine-origin"" or ""human-origin"" due to the genetic similarity of circulating viruses. This is the case for human-origin influenza A(H1N1) pandemic 2009 (pdm09) viruses detected in pigs following numerous reverse zoonosis events since the 2009 pandemic. We report the identification of two human infections with A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses originating from swine hosts and classify them as ""swine-origin"" variant influenza viruses based on phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison methods. Phylogenetic analyses of viral genomes from two cases revealed these viruses were reassortants containing A(H1N1)pdm09 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes with genetic combinations derived from the triple reassortant internal gene cassette. Follow-up investigations determined that one individual had direct exposure to swine in the week preceding illness onset, while another did not report swine exposure. The swine-origin A(H1N1) variant cases were resolved by full genome sequence comparison of the variant viruses to swine influenza genomes. However, if reassortment does not result in the acquisition of swine-associated genes and swine virus genomic sequences are not available from the exposure source, future cases may not be discernible. We have developed a pipeline that performs maximum likelihood analyses, a k-mer-based set difference algorithm, and random forest algorithms to identify swine-associated sequences in the hemagglutinin gene to differentiate between human-origin and swine-origin A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.IMPORTANCE Influenza virus infects a wide range of hosts, resulting in illnesses that vary from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia and death. Viral transfer can occur between human and nonhuman hosts, resulting in human and nonhuman origin viruses circulating in novel hosts. In this work, we have identified the first case of a swine-origin influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus resulting in a human infection. This shows that these viruses not only circulate in swine hosts, but are continuing to evolve and distinguish themselves from previously circulating human-origin influenza viruses. The development of techniques for distinguishing human-origin and swine-origin viruses are necessary for the continued surveillance of influenza viruses. We show that unique genetic signatures can differentiate circulating swine-associated strains from circulating human-associated strains of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and these signatures can be used to enhance surveillance of swine-origin influenza.",Journal Article,J Virol,95,2,,"Adult;Aged;Animals;Dogs;Female;Genome, Viral/genetics;Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/genetics;Humans;Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Influenza, Human/transmission/*virology;Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells;Male;Neuraminidase/genetics;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*virology;Pandemics/*veterinary;Phylogeny;Reassortant Viruses/classification/genetics/isolation & purification;Swine;Viral Proteins/genetics;Zoonoses/transmission/*virology;*A(H1N1)pdm09;*influenza;*pandemic;*random forest;*swine-origin;*zoonotic transmission",33115872,10.1128/jvi.01066-20,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x

More broadly, we do not know whether contacts between lions allow any pathogen with a relatively short infectious period to percolate through the population (i.e. reach epidemic proportions). We built one of the most realistic contact network models for a wildlife population to date, based on detailed behavioural and movement data from a long-term lion study population. The model allowed us to identify previously unrecognized biases in the sparse data from the 1994 outbreak and develop methods for judiciously inferring disease dynamics from typical wildlife samples.

Through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey, we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six Atlantic Forest fragments in southeast Brazil. RESULTS: Widespread exposure to canine parvovirus (97%), canine distemper virus (15%) and canine adenovirus (27%) was detected, but none for canine coronavirus. Dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks. Exposure was associated with dog sex and age, lack of health care and the number of people in the households. Remarkably, factors linked to free-ranging behaviour of dogs were associated with the exposure for all pathogens detected. CONCLUSIONS: According to identified associations, reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dog's movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance. Promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary. The study provides support for preventive management actions aimed to protect the health of rural dogs, and consequently of Atlantic Forest's wild carnivores.",Journal Article,BMC Vet Res,12,,21,"Adenoviruses, Canine;Animal Husbandry;Animals;Brazil/epidemiology;Distemper Virus, Canine;Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/*virology;Dogs;Female;Forests;Humans;Male;Parvovirus, Canine;Pets/virology;Prevalence;Risk Factors;Virus Diseases/epidemiology/prevention & control/*veterinary",26822375,10.1186/s12917-016-0646-3,1746-6148

Besides impacts of habitat changes caused by current rates of land conversion, climatic influences or predators, a contribution of infectious pathogens needs also to be considered. Infectious and non-infectious diseases in free-living populations of ring-necked pheasants have been scarcely investigated so far. In the present study, carcasses of 258 deceased free-ranging pheasants of different age groups, predominantly adult pheasants, collected over a period of 4ßyears in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein, were examined pathomorphologically, parasitologically, virologically and bacteriologically, with a focus set on infectious pathogens. A periocular and perinasal dermatitis of unknown origin was present in 62.3% of the pheasants. Additional alterations included protozoal cysts in the skeletal musculature (19.0%), hepatitis (21.7%), enteritis (18.7%), gastritis (12.6%), and pneumonia (11.7%). In single cases, neoplasms (2.6%) and mycobacteriosis (1.7%) occurred. Further findings included identification of coronaviral DNA from trachea or caecal tonsils (16.8%), siadenoviral DNA (7.6%), avian metapneumoviral RNA (6.6%), and infectious bursal disease viral RNA (3.7%). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on herpesvirus, avian influenza virus (AIV), paramyxovirus type 1 (PMV-1), avian encephalomyelitis virus (AEV), and chlamydia were negative. Based on the present results, there is no indication of a specific pathogen as a sole cause for population decline in adult pheasants.

The potential public health risk posed by this possibility of interspecies spread of IAV between dogs and humans necessitated surveillance for the virus in dogs and their human contacts. Sera from 239 asymptomatic pet and hunting dogs in Oyo state, Nigeria were screened for anti-IAV nucleoprotein antibodies using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) while haemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibodies in the positive sera were detected using influenza virus H3 and H5 subtypespecific antigens. Suspensions prepared from 239 and 39 nasal swabs from dogs and human contacts, respectively were tested for presence of the highly conserved IAV matrix gene by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Only 4 (1.7%) of the 239 sera tested were positive by the ELISA. The HI test confirmed the presence of H3 influenza virus subtype-specific antibodies in one (25.0%) of the 4 ELISA-positive sera with a titre of 1:128 while none was positive for H5 subtype-specific antibodies. All the nasal swabs assayed by RT-PCR were negative for IAV nucleic acid. The detection of IAV antibodies in pet and hunting dogs in this study, although at a low rate, suggests that these dogs could play a crucial role in the zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses especially considering the close interaction between them and their human contacts.

House sparrows were inoculated with either NY99 or Austria/2008 WNV strains, or sham-inoculated, and clinical and analytic parameters (viraemia, viral load, antibodies) were examined until 14 days after inoculation. Although all inoculated sparrows became infected, no mortality or clinical signs were observed due to the infection. However, the magnitude and duration of viraemia were higher for NY99 - than for Austria/2008 - infected birds. The house sparrow proved to be a competent host for both strains, although the competence index calculated for NY99 was higher than for Austria/2008. Viral load in tissues and swabs was also higher in NY99-inoculated sparrows. In conclusion, the house sparrow is a convenient avian model for studying host competence of WNV strains.

An overall prevalence of FMDV NSP reactive sera of 31.0% (216/696) was estimated, where a significant difference in seropositivity (p?=?0.000) was reported for buffalo (64.8%) as opposed to other wild animal species tested (17.8%). Different levels of exposure to the FMDV resulted for each of the buffalo subspecies sampled (p = 0.031): 68.4%, 50.0% and 0% for Nile Buffalo, West African Buffalo and African Forest Buffalo, respectively. The characterisation of the FMDV serotypes tested for buffalo found presence of antibodies against all the six FMDV serotypes tested, although high estimates for type O and SAT 3 were reported for Central Africa.

The results confirmed that FMDV circulates in wild ruminants populating both West and Central Africa rangelands and in particular in buffalo, also suggesting that multiple FMDV serotypes might be involved with type O, SAT 2 and SAT 1 being dominant.

These were associated with fibrinonecrotizing to pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis, embolic pneumonia, neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic meningochoroiditis, random neutrophilic hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis and epicarditis, necrotizing adrenalitis, suppurative endometritis, and multicentric reactive lymphadenopathy. Bacteriology and molecular analysis with sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified S. phocae from lung, brain, and adrenal gland tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis for morbillivirus detection revealed positive immunolabeling in the epithelium of the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle.

We evaluated SIV transmission to humans by screening 2,436 individuals that hunt and butcher non-human primates, a population in which simian foamy virus and simian T-lymphotropic virus were previously detected.

The most common VP7 genotype of human RVA is G1, but G1 is rarely detected in porcine strains. To understand the evolutionary relationships between human and porcine G1 VP7 genes, we sequenced the VP7 genes of three Japanese G1 porcine strains; the first two (PRV2, S80B) were isolated in 1980 and the third (Kyusyu-14) was isolated in 2001. Then, we performed phylogenetic and in-silico structural analyses. All three VP7 sequences clustered into lineage VI, and the mean nucleotide sequence identity between any pair of porcine G1 VP7 sequences belonging to lineage VI was 91.9%. In contrast, the mean nucleotide sequence identity between any pair of human G1 VP7 sequences belonging to lineages I-V was 95.5%. While the mean nucleotide sequence identity between any pair of porcine lineage VI strain and human lineage I-V strain was 85.4%, the VP7 genes of PRV2 and a rare porcine-like human G1P[6] strain (AU19) were 98% identical, strengthening the porcine RVA origin of AU19. The phylogenetic tree suggests that human G1 VP7 genes originated from porcine G1 VP7 genes. The time of their most recent common ancestor was estimated to be 1948, and human and porcine RVA strains evolved along independent pathways. In-silico structural analyses identified 7 amino acid residues within the known neutralisation epitopes that show differences in electric charges and shape between different porcine and human G1 strains. When compared with much divergent porcine G1 VP7 lineages, monophyletic, less divergent human G1 VP7 lineages support the hypothesis that all human G1 VP7 genes included in this study originated from a rare event of a porcine RVA transmitting to humans that was followed by successful adaptation to the human host.

Thus, the genotype constellation of an isolate is often indicative of its host species. Albeit rarely, interspecies transmission occurs either by virions with nonreassorted or reassorted genomic segments. A rotavirus with the G6P[1] genotype, Ro8059, was isolated from the stool of a 1-year-old child during routine characterization of diarrheal specimens from a sentinel clinic in Israel in 1995. Since genotype G6P[1] is generally associated with bovine rotaviruses, and the child developed diarrhea within days of his first contact with calves at an urban farm, the aim of this study was to characterize the whole genomic constellation of Ro8059 and four G6P[1] bovine strains, BRV101, BRV105, BRV106, and CR231/39, by RNA-RNA hybridization and full genome sequencing to determine whether some or all of the segments were of bovine origin. The genome constellations of all four bovine G6P[1] strains were G6-P[1]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 for VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5, respectively. Ro8059 shared the same genotype constellation with these bovine strains, with high nucleotide sequence identities (95.84 to 100%) for each of the 11 segments indicating that Ro8059 represented a direct interspecies whole-genome transmission of a nonreassorted rotavirus from a calf to a human infant.

A single adult male mule deer had BVDV antigen in the skin; staining distribution was consistent with that seen in PI cattle. Skin and lymph node were also positive for viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction, and the virus was determined to be a type 1. The prevalence of BVDV PI cervids in Colorado is very low. However, the identification of a naturally infected adult PI animal in the wild suggests that the virus infects free-ranging populations. The source of the BVDV is unknown and is assumed to be spillover from cattle or maintenance within wildlife populations. Consideration of a potential wild animal reservoir is important in the design and implementation of BVDV management practices in cattle.",Journal Article,J Vet Diagn Invest,20,5,650-3,"Animals;Animals, Wild/*virology;Colorado/epidemiology;Cross-Sectional Studies;Deer/virology;Diarrhea Viruses, Bovine Viral/*isolation & purification;Incidence;Pestivirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary;Ruminants/virology",18776103,10.1177/104063870802000521,1040-6387 (Print);1040-6387

This study was aimed at investigating circulating West Nile virus (WNV) strains in free-ranging corvids in Istanbul, Turkey. Brain, liver, and kidney were collected from corvids (n?=?34) between June 2019 and April 2020 and analyzed for the presence of WNV-specific RNA by quantitative RT-PCR. In addition, histopathologic and immunohistochemical examinations were also performed. Samples found to be positive by qRT-PCR were partially sequenced. WNV-specific RNA was detected in 8 of 34 corvids analyzed, which included 7 hooded crows (Corvus cornix) and 1 Eurasian magpie (Pica pica). Phylogenetic analysis based on partial WNV sequences from the 8 WNV-positive corvids identified in this study revealed that all sequences clustered within the WNV lineage-2; they were at least 97% homologues to WNV lineage-2 sequences from Slovakia, Italy, Czechia, Hungary, Senegal, Austria, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Germany. WNV sequences showed a divergence (87.94-94.46%) from sequences reported from Romania, Central African Republic, South Africa, Madagascar, Israel, and Cyprus, which clustered into a different clade of WNV lineage-2. Common histopathologic findings of WNV-positive corvids included lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis, myocarditis, and splenitis. The liver and heart were found to be the tissues most consistently positive for WNV-specific antigen by immunohistochemistry, followed by the kidney and brain. This study demonstrates for the first time the existence of WNV virus belonging to the genetic lineage-2 in resident corvids in Istanbul, Turkey. We hypothesize that the WNV strains circulating in Istanbul are possibly the result of a spillover event from Europe.

Analyzing records from 1985-2011 at the Instituto de Salud P?blica de Chile (ISP) and using ecological niche modeling, we address these questions to help in understanding rabies-bat ecological dynamics in South America. We found ecological niche identity between both hosts and both viral variants, indicating that niches of all actors in the system are undifferentiated, although the viruses do not necessarily occupy the full geographic distributions of their hosts.

Prominent rodent-borne zoonotic viruses include Puumala hantavirus (PUUV; the causative agent of nephropathia epidemica, NE), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and orthopoxviruses (OPV). In addition, Ljungan virus (LV) is considered a potentially zoonotic virus. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare clinical picture between acute PUUV patients with and without additional rodent-borne viral infections, to investigate if concurrent infections influence disease severity. STUDY DESIGN: We evaluated seroprevalence of and seroconversions to LCMV, LV and OPV in 116 patients hospitalized for NE. Clinical and laboratory variables were closely monitored during hospital care. RESULTS: A total of five LCMV, 15 LV, and one OPV seroconversions occurred. NE patients with LCMV seroconversions were younger, and had lower plasma creatinine concentrations and platelet counts than patients without LCMV seroconversions. No differences occurred in clinical or laboratory findings between patients with and without seroconversions to LV and OPV. We report, for the first time, LCMV seroprevalence in Finland, with 8.5% of NE patients seropositive for this virus. Seroprevalences for LV and OPV were 47.8% and 32.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cases with LCMV seroconversions were statistically younger, had milder acute kidney injury and more severe thrombocytopenia than patients without LCMV.

Rodent-borne Ljungan virus (LV) is considered potentially zoonotic possibly causing neurological symptoms. Our objective was to understand the role of these two viruses compared to other pathogens in causing neurological infections in Finnish patients. Routine screening data were available for 400 patients aged 5-50 years, collected from December 2013 to December 2014 with suspected neurological infection. Depending on symptoms, patients were variously tested for herpesviruses, enteroviruses, varicella zoster virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, while those suspected of tick bite were further tested for Borrelia spp. and tick-borne encephalitis virus using antibody and/or nucleic acid tests. For 380 patients, we also screened the RNA and antibody prevalence of LCMV and LV in order to test if either of these viruses were the causative agent. Data collected indicated that the causative microbial agent was confirmed in only 15.5% of all Finnish patients with neurological symptoms, with M. pneumoniae (26 cases) being the most common causative agent found in sera, whereas Borrelia spp. (15), herpes simplex viruses (7), and enteroviruses (5) were the most common agents confirmed in the CSF. The seroprevalences for LV and LCMV were 33.8% and 5.0%, respectively, but no samples were PCR-positive.

Ebolaviruses are considered to circulate in wildlife with occasional spillover events into the human population which then often leads to severe disease outbreaks. Several studies indicate a significant role of bats as reservoir hosts in the ebolavirus ecology. However, pigs from the Philippines have been found to be naturally infected with Reston virus (RESTV), an ebolavirus that is thought to only cause asymptomatic infections in humans. The recent report of ebolavirus-specific antibodies in pigs from Sierra Leone further supports natural infection of pigs with ebolaviruses. However, susceptibility of pigs to highly pathogenic Ebola virus (EBOV) was only shown under experimental settings and evidence for natural infection of pigs with EBOV is currently lacking. Between October and December 2017, we collected 308 serum samples from pigs in Guinea, West Africa, and tested for the presence of ebolavirus-specific antibodies with different serological assays. Besides reactivity to EBOV nucleoproteins in ELISA and Western blot for 19 (6.2%) and 13 (4.2%) samples, respectively, four sera recognized Sudan virus (SUDV) NP in Western blot. Furthermore, four samples specifically detected EBOV or SUDV glycoprotein (GP) in an indirect immunofluorescence assay under native conditions. Virus neutralization assay based on EBOV (Mayinga isolate) revealed five weakly neutralizing sera. The finding of (cross-) reactive and weakly neutralizing antibodies suggests the exposure of pigs from Guinea to ebolaviruses or ebola-like viruses with their pathogenicity as well as their zoonotic potential remaining unknown.

METHODS: We examined clinical specimens from the two donors and eight recipients, using viral culture, electron microscopy, serologic testing, molecular analysis, and histopathological examination with immunohistochemical staining to identify a cause. Epidemiologic investigations, including interviews, environmental assessments, and medical-record reviews, were performed to characterize clinical courses and to determine the cause of the illnesses. RESULTS: Laboratory testing revealed lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in all the recipients, with a single, unique strain of LCMV identified in each cluster. In both investigations, LCMV could not be detected in the organ donor. In the 2005 cluster, the donor had had contact in her home with a pet hamster infected with an LCMV strain identical to that detected in the organ recipients; no source of LCMV infection was found in the 2003 cluster. The transplant recipients had abdominal pain, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, elevated aminotransferase levels, coagulopathy, graft dysfunction, and either fever or leukocytosis within three weeks after transplantation. Diarrhea, peri-incisional rash, renal failure, and seizures were variably present. Seven of the eight recipients died, 9 to 76 days after transplantation.

Among the Felidae, numerous immunodeficiency-like lentiviruses have been documented, but only a few cross-species transmissions have been recorded, and these have not been perpetuated in the recipient species. Lentivirus seroprevalence was determined for 79 bobcats (Lynx rufus) and 31 pumas (Puma concolor) from well-defined populations in Southern California. Partial genomic sequences were subsequently obtained from 18 and 12 seropositive bobcats and pumas, respectively. Genotypes were analyzed for phylogenic relatedness and genotypic composition among the study set and archived feline lentivirus sequences. This investigation of feline immunodeficiency virus infection in bobcats and pumas of Southern California provides evidence that cross-species infection has occurred frequently among these animals. The data suggest that transmission has occurred in multiple locations and are most consistent with the spread of the virus from bobcats to pumas. Although the ultimate causes remain unknown, these transmission events may occur as a result of puma predation on bobcats, a situation similar to that which fostered transmission of HIV to humans, and likely represent the emergence of a lentivirus with relaxed barriers to cross-species transmission.

Rabbit HEV is now known to be widely prevalent in rabbits and tentatively assigned into genotype 3 (HEV-3) as subgenotype-3ra (HEV-3ra). However, its role in human infection remains undetermined. This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of HEV infection among rabbit slaughterhouse workers and to identify whether the workers exposed to rabbits are at a higher risk of HEV infection. Seventy-five workers at rabbit slaughterhouses and a control group of 421 general adults in the same area in Hebei province, China, were serologically examined for anti-HEV antibodies. HEV seroprevalences between the slaughterhouse workers and the general adults were compared. Age-adjusted prevalence of anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the rabbit slaughterhouse workers and control group was 46.1% and 10.8% respectively. The slaughterhouse workers had significantly higher seroprevalence and an approximately 6.9-fold increased risk for being seropositive for anti-HEV IgG as compared to the general population (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% CI: 4.3, 10.9). In slaughterhouse workers, anti-HEV IgG positive rate was positively associated with working years; in general adults, this rate was positively associated with age.

Therefore, analysis of the full genomes of human G8P[1] strains are of significance in the context of studies on interspecies transmission of rotaviruses. However, to date, only partial-length nucleotide sequences are available for the 11 genes of a single human G8P[1] strain, while the partial sequences of two other strains have been reported. The present study reports the first complete genome sequence of a human G8P[1] strain, B12, detected from an asymptomatic infant in Kenya in 1987. By nucleotide sequence identities and phylogenetic analyses, the full-length nucleotide sequences of VP7-VP4-VP6-VP1-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP2-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5 genes of strain B12 were assigned to G8-P[1]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A3-N2-T6-E2-H3 genotypes, respectively. Each of the 11 genes of strain B12 appeared to be more related to cognate genes of artiodactyl (ruminant and/or camelid) and/or artiodactyl-derived human GAR strains than those of most other rotaviruses. Strain B12 exhibited low levels of genetic relatedness to canonical human GAR strains, such as Wa and DS-1, ruling out the possibility of its origin from reassortment events between artiodactyl-like human and true human strains. These observations suggest that strain B12 might have been directly transmitted from artiodactyls to humans. Unhygienic conditions and close proximity of humans to livestock at the sampling site might have facilitated this rare event.

CAEV-like isolates, belonging to phylogenetic group C, were found among both seropositive sheep and goats in mixed flocks, in which sheep and goats are kept together. Intra-herd clustering confirmed that mixed flock animals were infected by the same virus variant, suggesting ongoing interspecies transmission. Few sheep flocks were found to be infected with the MVV-like phylogenetic group A. The apparent absence of SRLV group A type in goats is probably due to the MVV control programme and animal management practices. SRLV group C targets lungs and mammary glands in sheep, and induces typical SRLV pathological lesions. SRLV group C isolated from the sheep mammary glands suggested a productive infection and potential for transmission to offspring. SRLV group C was most prevalent among goats. A lower PCR sensitivity in seropositive sheep suggested a lower load of SRLV group C provirus in sheep than in goats. Higher genetic divergence of group C than in other SRLV groups and extensive heterogeneity among group C isolates in the matrix C-terminal region demonstrate the need for identifying conserved target regions when developing PCR protocols for SRLV detection.

Nasal swabs were collected from 42 adult female seals in April 2010, just after the animals had returned to the central California coast from their short post-breeding migration in the northeast Pacific. Swabs from two seals tested positive by RT-PCR for the matrix gene, and virus was isolated from each by inoculation into embryonic chicken eggs. Whole genome sequencing revealed greater than 99% homology with A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) that emerged in humans from swine in 2009. Analysis of more than 300 serum samples showed that samples collected early in 2010 (n?=?100) were negative and by April animals began to test positive for antibodies against the pH1N1 virus (HI titer of ?1?40), supporting the molecular findings. In vitro characterizations studies revealed that viral replication was indistinguishable from that of reference strains of pH1N1 in canine kidney cells, but replication was inefficient in human epithelial respiratory cells, indicating these isolates may be elephant seal adapted viruses.

The P gene sequence from the domestic dog shared 98% identity with the sequence data available for other CDV isolates of African carnivores. For the H gene, the two sequences available from the outbreak that decimated the lion population in Tanzania in 1994 were the closest match with the Namibian sample, being 94% identical across 1,122 base pairs (bp). Phylogenetic analyses based on this region clustered the Namibian sample with the CDV that is within the morbilliviruses. This is the first description of an epidemic involving black-backed jackals in Namibia, demonstrating that this species has the capacity for rapid and large-scale dissemination of CDV. This work highlights the threat posed to endangered wildlife in Namibia by the spillover of CDV from domestic dog populations.

Clinical and laboratory findings may not be specific in the early phase of the disease, hence bringing a challenge to the clinician. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to distinguish CCHF cases among all suspected cases by comparing them with non-CCHF cases with respect to characteristics during admission. METHODS: Cases with a presumptive diagnosis of CCHF at a secondary care hospital in Kastamonu in between 2014-2017 were evaluated, retrospectively. CCHF and non-CCHF cases were compared with respect to their clinical, laboratory and epidemiological characteristics during admission. RESULTS: Among 76 suspected patients, CCHF was found in 46.1% of them. Four-year fatality rate was 9.6% in CCHF cases. The frequency of headache, nausea/vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia less than 50x109/L, AST-ALT and LDH elevation, tick bites and contact with blood or body fluids of animals in CCHF cases were significantly higher than in non-CCHF cases (p<0.05).

Antibodies against non-structural proteins exhibited single cell reactions in salivary glands of mosquitoes and the C6/36 cell pellet. However, as single antibodies exhibited a cross reactivity of varying degree in non-infected specimens, a careful interpretation of positive reactions and consideration of adequate controls remains of critical importance.

The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections in the spring of 2009 quickly led to a worldwide pandemic in humans, with subsequent introduction of the virus to pig populations. Following a widespread infection in the human population in Norway, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was introduced to the influenza A na?ve Norwegian pig population, and within a few months pigs in more than one third of Norwegian swine herds had antibodies against the virus. A cross-sectional study was performed on all swine nucleus and multiplier herds in Norway to analyze risk factors for introduction of infection, and the preventive effects of recommended biosecurity practices. A surveillance program provided information on infection status of the study herds, and a questionnaire was administered to all 118 nucleus and multiplier herds to collect information on herd variables. The surveillance program revealed that pigs in 42% of the herds had antibodies against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. The incidence of serologically positive pigs was similar in both multiplier herds (41%) and closed nucleus herds (43%).

Like other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, ZIKV circulates in sylvatic cycles among primates that can serve as reservoirs of spillover infection to humans. Identifying sylvatic reservoirs is critical to mitigating spillover risk, but relevant surveillance and biological data remain limited for this and most other zoonoses. We confronted this data sparsity by combining a machine learning method, Bayesian multi-label learning, with a multiple imputation method on primate traits. The resulting models distinguished flavivirus-positive primates with 82% accuracy and suggest that species posing the greatest spillover risk are also among the best adapted to human habitations.

Multiple studies suggest that dromedary camels are a source for human MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV-specific antibodies have been detected in the serum of dromedary camels across Northern Africa and across the Arabian Peninsula. Israel's geographic location places Israel at risk for MERS-CoV infection. To date, MERS-CoV-related illness has not been reported and the burden of MERS-CoV infection in the Israeli population is unknown. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies in Israeli dromedary camels is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MERS-CoV seropositivity in dromedary camels in Israel. The prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in Israeli camels was examined in 71 camel sera collected from four farms across Israel by MERS-CoV-specific microneutralization (Mnt) assay and confirmed by MERS-CoV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Although this study cannot rule out potential antibody cross-reactivity by IFA, the presence of bovine coronavirus-specific antibodies do not appear to impact detection of MERS-CoV antibodies by Mnt. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detectable in 51 (71.8%) camel sera, and no association was observed between the presence of neutralizing antibodies and camel age or gender. These findings extend the known range of MERS-CoV circulation in Middle Eastern camels.

Four chimpanzee samples were positive, but none of the gorilla samples were positive. Genetic characterization of the VP1, VP4, and partial VP2 genes, the 5' untranslated region, and partial 3Dpol sequences enabled chimpanzee-derived EVs to be identified as (i) the species A type, EV76, (ii) a new species D type assigned as EV111, along with a human isolate from the Democratic Republic of Congo previously described by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, and (iii) a new species B type (assigned as EV110) most closely related to, although a distinct type from, the SA5 isolate recovered from a vervet monkey. The identification of EVs infecting chimpanzees related to those circulating in human and OWM populations provides evidence for cross-species transmission of EVs between primates.

Recently, CoVs were recognized as important pathogens in captive wild ruminants. This is the first report of the isolation and detailed genetic, biologic, and antigenic characterization of a bovine-like CoV from a giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) in a wild-animal park in the United States. CoV particles were detected by immune electron microscopy in fecal samples from three giraffes with mild-to-severe diarrhea. From one of the three giraffe samples, a CoV (GiCoV-OH3) was isolated and successfully adapted to serial passage in human rectal tumor 18 cell cultures. Hemagglutination assays, receptor-destroying enzyme activity, hemagglutination inhibition, and fluorescence focus neutralization tests revealed close biological and antigenic relationships between the GiCoV-OH3 isolate and selected respiratory and enteric bovine CoV (BCoV) strains. When orally inoculated into a BCoV-seronegative gnotobiotic calf, GiCoV-OH3 caused severe diarrhea and virus shedding within 2 to 3 days. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses were performed to assess its genetic relatedness to other CoVs. Molecular characterization confirmed that the new isolate belongs to group 2a of the mammalian CoVs and revealed closer genetic relatedness between GiCoV-OH3 and the enteric BCoVs BCoV-ENT and BCoV-DB2, whereas BCoV-Mebus was more distantly related. Detailed sequence analysis of the GiCoV-OH3 spike gene demonstrated the presence of a deletion in the variable region of the S1 subunit (from amino acid 543 to amino acid 547), which is a region associated with pathogenicity and tissue tropism for other CoVs. The point mutations identified in the structural proteins (by comparing GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, BCoV-DB2, and BCoV-Mebus) were most conserved among GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, and BCoV-DB2, whereas most of the point mutations in the nonstructural proteins were unique to GiCoV-OH3.

Among avian influenza A viruses (AIV), H5, H7, and H9 subtypes have the most zoonotic potential. Captive birds in zoos and safari parks are used for educational, recreational, breeding, and conservational purposes in Bangladesh. To screen for AIV in captive birds to assess potential public health threats, we conducted a cross-sectional study in two safari parks and one zoo in Bangladesh for four months, from November to December 2013 and from January to February 2014. We collected blood samples, oropharyngeal, and cloacal swabs from 228 birds. We tested serum samples for AIV antibodies using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and AIV sero-subtype H5, H7, and H9 using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Swab samples were tested for the presence of avian influenza viral RNA using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Across all the samples, AIV antibody prevalence was 9.7% (95% CI: 6.1-14.2, n = 228) and AIV HA subtype H5, H7 and H9 sero-prevalence was 0% (95% CI: 0-1.6, n = 228), 0% (95% CI: 0-1.6, n = 228) and 6.6% (95% CI: 3.72-10.6, n = 228), respectively. No AI viral RNA (M-gene) was detected in any swab sample (0%, 95% CI: 0-1.6, n = 228). Birds in the Safari park at Cox's Bazar had a higher prevalence in both AIV antibody prevalence (13.5%) and AIV H9 sero-prevalence (9.6%) than any of the other sites, although the difference was not statistically significant. Among eight species of birds, Emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) had the highest sero-positivity for both AIV antibody prevalence (26.1%) and AIV H9 prevalence (17.4%) followed by Golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) with AIV antibody prevalence of 18.2% and AIV H9 prevalence of 11.4%. Our results highlight the presence of AI antibodies indicating low pathogenic AIV mingling in captive birds in zoos and safari parks in Bangladesh.

Sporadic autochthonous cases of hepatitis E have been reported recently in the United States and other industrialized countries. The source of HEV infection in these cases is unknown; zoonotic transmission has been suggested. Antibodies to HEV have been detected in many animals in areas where HEV is endemic and in domestic swine and rats in the United States. There is evidence supporting HEV transmission between swine and humans. Nevertheless, HEV has not been detected in wild rodents. We tested murid rodents and house shrews trapped in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley, where hepatitis E is hyperendemic, for HEV infection. The most commonly trapped species was Rattus rattus brunneusculus. Serum samples from 675 animals were tested for immunoglobulin G against HEV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; 78 (12%) were positive, indicating acute or past infection. Antibody prevalence was higher among R. rattus brunneusculus and Bandicota bengalensis than in Suncus murinus. Forty-four specimens from 78 antibody-positive animals had sufficient residual volume for detection of HEV RNA (viremia) by reverse transcription-PCR. PCR amplification detected four animals (9%; three were R. rattus brunneusculus and one was B. bengalensis) with viremia. Phylogenetic analysis of the four genome sequences (405 bp in the capsid gene) recovered showed that they were identical, most closely related to two human isolates from Nepal (95 and 96% nucleotide homology, respectively), and distinct from HEV sequences isolated elsewhere.

Using cross-sectional serosurvey data collected in 2016, our study investigated PPRV seroprevalence and risk factors among sheep, goats and cattle in 20 agropastoral (AP) and pastoral (P) villages in northern Tanzania. Overall observed seroprevalence was 21.1% (95% exact confidence interval (CI) 20.1-22.0) with 5.8% seroprevalence among agropastoral (95% CI 5.0-6.7) and 30.7% among pastoral villages (95% CI 29.3-32.0).

However, limited data on RVA diversity is available from sub-Saharan Africa in general and the COD in particular. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to determine the genetic diversity of 99 RVAs detected during 2007-2010 in Kisangani, COD. The predominant G-type was G1 (39%) and the most predominant P-type was P[6] (53%). A total of eight different G/P-combinations were found: G1P[8] (28%), G8P[6] (26%), G2P[4] (14%), G12P[6] (13%), G1P[6] (11%), G9P[8] (4%), G4P[6] (2%) and G8P[4] (1%). The second aim of this study was to gain insight into the diversity of P[6] RVA strains in the COD. Therefore, we selected five P[6] RVA strains in combination with the G1, G4, G8 (2x) or G12 genotype for complete genome analysis. Complete genome analysis showed that the genetic background of the G1P[6] and G12P[6] strains was entirely composed of genotype 1 (Wa-like), while the segments of the two G8P[6] strains were identified as genotype 2 (DS-1-like). Interestingly, all four strains possessed a NSP4 gene of animal origin. The analyzed G4P[6] RVA strain was found to possess the unusual G4-P[6]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T7-E1-H1 constellation. Although the majority of its genes (if not all), were presumably of porcine origin, this strain was able to cause gastro-enteritis in humans. The high prevalence of unusual RVA strains in the COD highlights the need for continued surveillance of RVA diversity in the COD. These results also underline the importance of complete genetic characterization of RVA strains and indicate that reassortments and interspecies transmission among human and animal RVAs strains occur regularly.

METHODS: To investigate the genomic relationship between African and Asian human P[6] rotaviruses and P[4] and P[8] rotaviruses circulating worldwide, we sequenced 39 P[6] strains, collected in Ghana, Mali, Kenya and Bangladesh, providing the largest data set of P[6] rotavirus genomes isolated in low-income countries or anywhere else in the world that has been published thus far. RESULTS: Overall, the data indicate that the genetic backbone of human P[6] strains from the low-income countries are similar to those of P[4] or P[8] strains circulating worldwide. CONCLUSIONS: The observation that gene segment 4 is the main differentiator between human P[6] and non-P[6] strains suggests that the VP4 spike protein is most likely one of the main reasons preventing the rapid spread of P[6] strains to the rest of the world despite multiple introductions.

We analyzed AIV genomic sequences from North American wild birds, including 303 newly sequenced isolates, to estimate interspecies and geographic viral transition patterns among multiple co-circulating subtypes. Our results show high transition rates within Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, but limited transitions between these orders. Patterns of transition between species were positively associated with breeding habitat range overlap, and negatively associated with host genetic distance. Distance between regions (negative correlation) and summer temperature at origin (positive correlation) were strong predictors of transition between locations.

It is therefore crucial to identify differential patterns of infection and understand the mechanisms responsible. Yet our understanding of infection heterogeneity in wildlife is limited, even for important zoonotic host-pathogen systems, owing to the intractability of host status prior to infection. Using novel applications of stable isotope ecology and eco-immunology, we distinguish antecedent behavioural and physiological traits associated with avian influenza virus (AIV) infection in free-living Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii). Swans infected with AIV exhibited higher serum ?13C (-25.3?0.4) than their non-infected counterparts (-26.3?0.2). Thus, individuals preferentially foraging in aquatic rather than terrestrial habitats experienced a higher risk of infection, suggesting that the abiotic requirements of AIV give rise to heterogeneity in pathogen exposure. Juveniles were more likely to be infected (30.8% compared with 11.3% for adults), shed approximately 15-fold higher quantity of virus and exhibited a lower specific immune response than adults.

Thus, this study aimed to identify new zoonotic sources that bear a high risk of transmission to humans. We collected fecal, blood, and milk samples of cows in a typical rural region of Yunnan Province in southwest China, where mixed farming of domestic animals is a common practice.

We found a high prevalence of active HEV infection in cows as determined by viral RNA positivity in fecal samples. Surprisingly, we discovered that HEV is excreted into milk that is produced by infected cows. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all HEV isolates from cow/milk belong to genotype 4 and subtype 4h. Gavage with HEV-contaminated raw and even pasteurized milk resulted in active infection in rhesus macaques. Importantly, a short period of boiling, but not pasteurization, could completely inactivate HEV. CONCLUSION: Infectious HEV-contaminated cow milk is recognized as a new zoonotic source that bears a high risk of transmission to humans; these results call attention to understanding and establishing proper measurement and control of HEV zoonotic transmission, particularly in the setting of mixed farming of domestic animals.

Studies on the phylodynamics of IAVs across different scales - from the individual to the population - are essential for devising effective measures to predict, prevent or contain influenza emergence. Understanding how IAVs spread and evolve during outbreaks is critical for the management of epidemics. Reconstructing the transmission network during a single outbreak by sampling viral genetic data in time and space can generate insights about these processes. Here, we obtained intra-host viral sequence data from horses infected with equine influenza virus (EIV) to reconstruct the spread of EIV during a large outbreak. To this end, we analyzed within-host viral populations from sequences covering 90% of the infected yards. By combining gene sequence analyses with epidemiological data, we inferred a plausible transmission network, in turn enabling the comparison of transmission patterns during the course of the outbreak and revealing important epidemiological features that were not apparent using either approach alone. The EIV populations displayed high levels of genetic diversity, and in many cases we observed distinct viral populations containing a dominant variant and a number of related minor variants that were transmitted between infectious horses.

Since then, several bats throughout the world have been shown to shed CoV sequences, and presumably CoVs, in the feces; however, no bat CoVs have been isolated from nature. Moreover, there are very few bat cell lines or reagents available for investigating CoV replication in bat cells or for isolating bat CoVs adapted to specific bat species. Here, we show by molecular clock analysis that alphacoronavirus (?-CoV) sequences derived from the North American tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) are predicted to share common ancestry with human CoV (HCoV)-NL63, with the most recent common ancestor between these viruses occurring approximately 563 to 822 years ago. Further, we developed immortalized bat cell lines from the lungs of this bat species to determine if these cells were capable of supporting infection with HCoVs. While SARS-CoV, mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15), and chimeric SARS-CoVs bearing the spike genes of early human strains replicated inefficiently, HCoV-NL63 replicated for multiple passages in the immortalized lung cells from this bat species.

The systematic use of improved tools for diagnosing and genotyping has completely changed our understanding of the epidemiology and clinical consequences of HEV infection. Most cases of HEV in Europe arise from infected animals such as pigs, wild boar, deer and rabbits. Zoonotic HEV genotypes (HEV genotypes 3-8) are mainly food-borne or transmitted by direct contact, but recent data suggest that infection can also be water-borne or even iatrogenic throught contamined blood products. HEV-3 is the most prevalent genotype in Europe but the geographic distributions of the 3 major clades and subgenotypes (HEV-3abjkchi, HEV-3efg, and HEV-3ra) differ. Most HEV-3 infections are asymptomatic but they can result in severe acute hepatitis in patients with chronic liver disease, chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients, and to extra-hepatic manifestations. Despite more frequent reports of symptomatic hepatitis E cases across Europe, systems for monitoring HEV infections vary greatly. Severe HEV-associated illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths are probably underestimated. The seroprevalence and incidence of locally acquired hepatitis E varies between and within European countries and over time. The precise origin of these variations is uncertain but may be linked to environmental factors or the degree to which HEV contaminates the human food chain.

METHODS: In total, 174 anti-HEV antibody positive human sera samples; 1419 blood or faeces samples of swine, as well as 720 tissue and/or blood samples of wild boar originating from different counties (18 in total) in Croatia were tested for the presence of HEV RNA. RESULTS: HEV RNA was detected in 26 human sera samples (14.9%; 95% CI 10.4-21.0%). HEV RNA was detected in 216 tested swine (15.2%; 95% CI 13.5-17.1%), regardless of age, farm breeding system or geographical origin. Viral RNA was also detectable in faeces samples which prove that swine actively participate in shedding HEV into the environment. Of the total of 720 tested wild boar samples, 83 were HEV RNA positive (11.5, 95% CI 9.4-14.1%) originating from six counties. According to the sequence analysis all strains have shown to be members of Orthohepevirus A genotype HEV-3, regardless of host. The genotyping results confirm grouping of sequences into four subtypes of HEV strains of which subtypes 3a and 3c belong to the general cluster 3abchij, and were predominately detected during the study, while subtypes 3e and 3f fall within cluster 3efg. Strains within subtypes 3a and 3e were found in humans, swine and wild boars; subtype 3c strains were derived from humans and swine, whereas subtype 3f strains were found only in humans. Strains belonging to subtypes 3a and 3c were derived during the entire investigated period and may be considered endemic in Croatia, whereas strains within subtypes 3e and 3f were detected sporadically indicating the possibility of newly imported infections. CONCLUSIONS: All detected strains show to be genetically highly related to strains found in humans and/or animals from other European Countries, indicating that trade of live animals or wild boar movement increases the risk of HEV infection spread. Furthermore, homologous strains found in different investigated species within this study indicate interspecies transmission of HEV and/or an existence of an accessible mutual source of infection.",Journal Article,BMC Infect Dis,19,1,269,"Animals;Croatia;Feces/virology;Genetic Variation/genetics;*Hepatitis E/epidemiology/veterinary/virology;Hepatitis E virus/*genetics;Humans;RNA, Viral/analysis/blood/genetics;Sus scrofa/virology;Swine/virology;*Swine Diseases/epidemiology/virology;Hepatitis E virus genotyping;Human;Swine;Wild boar;experiments or trials.

L.",2014,Novel NSP1 genotype characterised in an African camel G8P[11] rotavirus strain,"Animal-human interspecies transmission is thought to play a significant role in influencing rotavirus strain diversity in humans. Proving this concept requires a better understanding of the complete genetic constellation of rotaviruses circulating in various animal species. However, very few whole genomes of animal rotaviruses, especially in developing countries, are available. In this study, complete genetic configuration of the first African camel rotavirus strain (RVA/Camel-wt/SDN/MRC-DPRU447/2002/G8P[11]) was assigned a unique G8-P[11]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A18-N2-T6-E2-H3 genotype constellation that has not been reported in other ruminants. It contained a novel NSP1 genotype (genotype A18). The evolutionary dynamics of the genome segments of strain MRC-DPRU447 were rather complex compared to those found in other camelids. Its genome segments 1, 3, 7-10 were closely related (>93% nucleotide identity) to those of human-animal reassortant strains like RVA/Human-tc/ITA/PA169/1988/G6P[14] and RVA/Human-wt/HUN/Hun5/1997/G6P[14], segments 4, 6 and 11 shared common ancestry (>95% nucleotide identity) with bovine rotaviruses like strains RVA/Cow-wt/CHN/DQ-75/2008/G10P[11] and RVA/Cow-wt/KOR/KJ19-2/XXXX/G6P[7], whereas segment 2 was closely related (94% nucleotide identity) to guanaco rotavirus strain RVA/Guanaco-wt/ARG/Rio_Negro/1998/G8P[1]. Its genetic backbone consisted of DS-1-like, AU-1-like, artiodactyl-like and a novel A18 genotype. This suggests that strain MRC-DPRU447 potentially emerged through multiple reassortment events between several mammalian rotaviruses of at least two genogroups or simply strain MRC-DPRU447 display a unique progenitor genotypes. Close relationship between some of the genome segments of strain MRC-DPRU447 to human rotaviruses suggests previous occurrence of reassortment processes combined with interspecies transmission between humans and camels.

The aims of the present study were to describe the first SBD outbreak in Spain and to assess the spread and risk factors associated with SBV infection in domestic ruminants from nearby farms during the following year. In March 2012, one malformed stillborn lamb from a sheep farm located in Cordoba province (Southern Spain) was subjected to necropsy. Pathological compatible lesions and molecular analyses confirmed the first SBV infection in Spain. Afterwards, serum samples from 505 extensively reared domestic ruminants from 29 farms were analysed using both blocking ELISA and virus neutralization test against SBV. The overall seroprevalence was 54.4% (CI(95%): 50.0-58.7). Antibodies were detected in 70.6%, 46.0% and 34.8% of cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. A generalized estimating equation model indicated that the main risk factors associated with SBV infection were: species (cattle), age (adult), and absence of animal insecticide treatment. Pathological and molecular results confirmed the presence of SBV in Spain few months after it was firstly identified in Germany. The seroprevalence detected indicates a widespread circulation of SBV in nearby domestic ruminant farms one year after this first outbreak was reported in Spain.

A.",2018,The impact of paralytic bovine rabies transmitted by vampire bats in Latin America and the Caribbean,"The effective control of dog rabies in Latin America is justifiably seen as a major success in the struggle to limit this devastating zoonosis. However, rabies remains a problem, due to the presence of the virus in bat populations throughout the region, including vampire bats. Vampire bats obtain nutrition exclusively through consuming blood by biting mammals and birds. This makes the species a highly efficient vector of the rabies virus, responsible for sporadic outbreaks of rabies in human populations and numerous cases of rabies in livestock. This, in turn, causes economic losses to the farming industry in countries throughout the region. For over four decades, efforts to control rabies have been directed at controlling the reservoir species and vaccinating cattle. However, this approach has not eliminated rabies in livestock. A major barrier to innovation in vampire rabies control is a lack of consistent surveillance to establish the extent of the problem. This precludes any calculation of its cost to the economy or the cost of potential solutions, such as vaccinating livestock. This paper outlines the problem of livestock rabies in Latin America and considers factors that influence the economic cost of potential solutions to this continuing challenge to human and livestock health.",Journal Article,Rev Sci Tech,37,2,451-459,Animals;Caribbean Region/epidemiology;Cattle;Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/*pathology/virology;*Chiroptera;*Disease Vectors;Humans;Latin America/epidemiology;Rabies/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary;Rabies virus;Zoonoses;Bovine paralytic rabies;Caribbean;Control;Latin America;Rabies;Vaccination;Vampire bat,30747135,10.20506/rst.37.2.2814,0253-1933 (Print);0253-1933

We found that viral persistence through transmission among acutely infected hosts alone is unlikely.

Many wild artiodactyls are susceptible to PPR virus (PPRV) infection, and some outbreaks have threatened endangered wild populations. The role of wild species in PPRV epidemiology is unclear, which is a knowledge gap for the Global Strategy for the Control and Eradication of PPR. These studies aimed to investigate PPRV infection in wild artiodactyls in the Greater Serengeti and Amboseli ecosystems of Kenya and Tanzania. Out of 132 animals purposively sampled in 2015-2016, 19.7% were PPRV seropositive by ID Screen PPR competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA; IDvet, France) from the following species: African buffalo, wildebeest, topi, kongoni, Grant's gazelle, impala, Thomson's gazelle, warthog and gerenuk, while waterbuck and lesser kudu were seronegative. In 2018-2019, a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected African buffalo and Grant's gazelle herds was conducted. The weighted estimate of PPRV seroprevalence was 12.0% out of 191 African buffalo and 1.1% out of 139 Grant's gazelles. All ocular and nasal swabs and faeces were negative by PPRV real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Investigations of a PPR-like disease in sheep and goats confirmed PPRV circulation in the area by rapid detection test and/or RT-qPCR. These results demonstrated serological evidence of PPRV infection in wild artiodactyl species at the wildlife-livestock interface in this ecosystem where PPRV is endemic in domestic small ruminants. Exposure to PPRV could be via spillover from infected small ruminants or from transmission between wild animals, while the relatively low seroprevalence suggests that sustained transmission is unlikely. Further studies of other major wild artiodactyls in this ecosystem are required, such as impala, Thomson's gazelle and wildebeest.",Journal Article,Viruses,13,5,,"Animal Diseases/epidemiology/history/virology;Animals;Animals, Wild/*virology;Cross-Sectional Studies;Disease Outbreaks;*Ecosystem;Geography, Medical;History, 21st Century;Kenya/epidemiology;Livestock/*virology;Peste-des-Petits-Ruminants/*epidemiology/history/*virology;Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus/classification/*physiology;Public Health Surveillance;Seroepidemiologic Studies;Tanzania/epidemiology;*Kenya;*ppr;*Tanzania;*epidemiology;*eradication;*goats;*sheep;*surveillance;*transboundary animal disease;*wild animals;design of the study;in the collection, analyses, or interpretation of data;in;the writing of the manuscript, or in the decision to publish the results.

A pathogen's ability to adapt to a new host (i.e. host shift) oftentimes is constrained by host phylogeny, due to limits in the molecular mechanisms available to overcome host-specific immune defences (Longdon etßal.,ß2014). Some pathogens, such as RNA viruses, however, have a propensity to jump hosts due to rapid mutation rates. For example, canine distemper virus (CDV) infects a broad range of terrestrial carnivores, as well as noncarnivore species worldwide, with a host range that is distributed across 5 orders and 22 families (Beineke etßal.,ß2015). In 1993-1994, a severe CDV outbreak infected multiple carnivore host species in Serengeti National Park, causing widespread mortality and the subsequent decline of the African lion (Panthera leo) population (Roelke-Parker etßal.,ß1996).

L.",2020,Aerosol Transmission from Infected Swine to Ferrets of an H3N2 Virus Collected from an Agricultural Fair and Associated with Human Variant Infections,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) sporadically transmit from swine to humans, typically associated with agricultural fairs in the United States. A human seasonal H3 virus from the 2010-2011 IAV season was introduced into the U.S. swine population and termed H3.2010.1 to differentiate it from the previous swine H3 virus. This H3N2 lineage became widespread in the U.S. commercial swine population, subsequently spilling over into exhibition swine, and caused a majority of H3N2 variant (H3N2v) cases in humans in 2016 and 2017. A cluster of human H3N2v cases were reported at an agricultural fair in 2017 in Ohio, where 2010.1 H3N2 IAV was concurrently detected in exhibition swine. Genomic analysis showed that the swine and human isolates were nearly identical. In this study, we evaluated the propensity of a 2010.1 H3N2 IAV (A/swine/Ohio/A01354299/2017 [sw/OH/2017]) isolated from a pig in the agricultural fair outbreak to replicate in ferrets and transmit from swine to ferret. sw/OH/2017 displayed robust replication in the ferret respiratory tract, causing slight fever and moderate weight loss. Further, sw/OH/2017 was capable of efficient respiratory droplet transmission from infected pigs to contact ferrets. These findings establish a model for evaluating the propensity of swine IAV to transmit from pig to ferret as a measure of risk to the human population. The identification of higher-risk swine strains can then be targeted for control measures to limit the dissemination at human-swine interfaces to reduce the risk of zoonotic infections and to inform pandemic planning.IMPORTANCE A recently emerged lineage of human-like H3N2 (H3.2010.1) influenza A virus (IAV) from swine has been frequently detected in commercial and exhibition swine in recent years and has been associated with H3N2 variant cases in humans from 2016 and 2017. To demonstrate a model for characterizing the potential for zoonotic transmission associated with swine IAV, we performed an in vivo study of transmission between pigs infected with an H3.2010.1 H3N2 IAV and aerosol contact ferrets. The efficient interspecies transmission demonstrated for the H3.2010.1 IAV in swine emphasizes the need for further characterization of viruses circulating at the swine-human interface for transmission potential prior to human spillover and the development and implementation of more robust vaccines and control strategies to mitigate human exposure to higher-risk swine strains.",Journal Article,J Virol,94,16,,"Aerosols;Animals;Cross Reactions/immunology;Ferrets/virology;Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/metabolism;Humans;Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/genetics;Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/*metabolism/pathogenicity;Influenza A virus/metabolism/pathogenicity;Influenza, Human/virology;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*transmission/virology;Swine/virology;Swine Diseases/virology;United States;Zoonoses/*transmission/virology;*h3n2;*ferrets;*human-like;*influenza;*swine;*transmission",32522849,10.1128/jvi.01009-20,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x

G.",2020,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in tortoises and Hyalomma aegyptium ticks in East Thrace, Turkey: potential of a cryptic transmission cycle","BACKGROUND: Recent reports have demonstrated the presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) genomic material in Hyalomma aegyptium ticks feeding primarily on tortoises belonging to the genus Testudo. This raises the question if these ticks and their hosts play a role in the natural transmission dynamics of CCHFV. However, the studies are limited, and assessing the relevance of H. aegyptium in perpetuating the virus in nature, and a potential spillover to humans remains unknown. This study aimed to detect CCHFV in H. aegyptium ticks and their tortoise hosts in the East Thrace region of Turkey, where H. aegyptium is the most common human-biting tick and where a high density of tortoises of the genus Testudo can be found. METHODS: During the study period, 21 blood samples from different tortoises (2 T. hermanni and 19 T. graeca), 106 tick pools (containing 448 males, 152 females, 93 nymphs and 60 larvae) collected from 65 tortoises (5 T. hermanni and 60 T. graeca), 38 adult unfed questing ticks (25 males and 13 females, screened individually) and 14 pools (containing 8 nymphs and 266 larvae) of immature unfed questing ticks collected from the ground were screened for CCHFV genome by nested PCR and partial genomes sequenced. RESULTS: As a result of the screening of these 179 samples, 17 (9.5%) were detected as positive as follows: 2 of 21 blood samples (9.52%), 13 (containing 18 nymphs in 3 pools, and 52 males and 8 females in 10 pools) of 106 tick pools from tortoises (12.26%), and 2 of 38 adult questing ticks (5.26%). No positive result was determined in 14 pools of immature questing ticks. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have shown that reptiles can participate in the transmission of arthropod-borne viruses, but they may contribute to different aspects of the disease ecology and evolution of tick-borne viral pathogens. Our results indicate the presence of CCHFV in questing and feeding H. aegyptium ticks as well as tortoise hosts. This may indicate that CCHFV circulates in a cryptic transmission cycle in addition to the primary transmission cycle that could play a role in the natural dynamic of the virus and the transmission to humans.",Journal Article,Parasit Vectors,13,1,201,"Animals;Arachnid Vectors/virology;DNA, Viral;Disease Reservoirs/virology;*Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Crimean-Congo/genetics/isolation & purification;Hemorrhagic Fever, Crimean/*transmission;Phylogeny;Polymerase Chain Reaction;Ticks/*virology;Turkey/epidemiology;Turtles/parasitology/*virology;Zoonoses/*virology;Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus;Cryptic transmission cycle;Hyalomma aegyptium;Thrace;Tortoise;Turkey",32307010,10.1186/s13071-020-04074-6,1756-3305

The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans. METHODS: This study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (2014-2016). Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected. Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection. The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed. RESULTS: The data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle. MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels. Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV. The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula.

In this study, we used logistic regression to investigate serological evidence of previous infection with avian influenza subtypes H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H9, H10, and H11 among 95 adults occupationally exposed to turkeys in the US Midwest and 82 unexposed controls. Our results indicate that farmers practising backyard, organic or free-ranging turkey production methods are at an increased risk of infection with avian influenza. Among these farmers, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for elevated microneutralization assay titres against avian H4, H5, H6, H9, and H10 influenza strains ranged between 3.9 (95% CI 1.2-12.8) and 15.3 (95% CI 2.0-115.2) when compared to non-exposed controls. The measured ORs were adjusted for antibody titres against human influenza viruses and other exposure variables. These data suggest that sometime in their lives, the workers had been exposed to low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses.

HEV can cause chronic infection and cirrhosis in the immunosuppressed, including patients with HIV infection. Little is known about HEV and HIV coinfection. The aim of the study was to document the incidence of chronic HEV coinfection in patients with HIV infection and to determine the anti-HEV seroprevalence and compare it with that of a control population. METHODS: A cohort/case-control study was carried out in two teaching hospitals in southwest England. A total of 138 patients with HIV infection were tested for HEV using an immunoassay for anti-HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and 464 control subjects were tested for anti-HEV IgG. Demographic, lifestyle and laboratory data were prospectively collected on each patient with HIV infection. The anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence in patients with HIV infection was compared with that in controls and demographic risk factors for HEV exposure were explored using logistic regression models. RESULTS: There was no difference in anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence between the HIV-infected patients and controls. The only risk factor predictive of anti-HEV seropositivity was the consumption of raw/undercooked pork; sexual risk factors were unrelated. No patient with HIV infection had evidence of chronic coinfection with HEV CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HEV seroprevalence is similar in controls and patients with HIV infection.

METHODS: Slaughterhouse workers from 80 workplaces nationwide were surveyed in South Korea in 2012. The subjects comprised 1848 cases: 1434 slaughter workers and 414 residual products handlers. By visiting 80 slaughterhouses, which were mixed with 75 of which also performed residual products handling, we conducted a questionnaire survey for risk factors and obtained blood samples in order to determine the seropositivity and seroprevalence of HEV. Anti-HEV IgG and IgM were measured using HEV IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunospecific assay kits and HEV antigen was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The seropositivity of anti-HEV IgG was 33.5% (slaughter workers 32.8% and residual products handlers 36.2%), and among the seropositive individuals the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgM was 0.5% (slaughter workers 0.5%, residual products handlers 0.7%).

Therefore, a total of 367 serum samples from wild animals were collected near major migratory bird habitats from 2011 to 2016 and tested by AIV-specific blocking ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Two mammalian and eight avian species were seropositive according to the ELISA test. Among these, two mammalian (Hydropotes inermis and Prionailurus bengalensis) and three avian (Aegypius monachus, Cygnus cygnus, and Bubo bubo) species showed high HI titres (>ß1,280) against one or two H5-subtype AIVs. As H. inermis (water deer), P. bengalensis (leopard cat), and B. bubo (Eurasian eagle owl) are indigenous animals in Korea, evidence of H5-subtype AIV in these animals implies that continuous monitoring of indigenous animals should be followed to understand interspecies transmission ecology of H5-subtype influenza viruses.",Journal Article,Arch Virol,163,3,649-657,"Animals;Animals, Wild/virology;Antibodies, Viral/*blood;Birds/virology;Deer/virology;Epidemiological Monitoring;Felidae/virology;Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests;Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype/classification/immunology/*isolation &;purification;Influenza A Virus, H5N2 Subtype/classification/immunology/*isolation &;purification;Influenza A Virus, H5N8 Subtype/classification/immunology/*isolation &;purification;Influenza in Birds/blood/*epidemiology/immunology/virology;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/blood/*epidemiology/immunology/virology;Phylogeny;Republic of Korea/epidemiology",29204739,10.1007/s00705-017-3655-z,0304-8608

T.",2022,High Prevalence of Antibodies against Canine Parvovirus and Canine Distemper Virus among Coyotes and Foxes from Pennsylvania: Implications for the Intersection of Companion Animals and Wildlife,"Canine distemper virus (CDV) and Canine parvovirus (CPV) can cause deadly infections in wildlife and companion animals. In this report, we screened serum from free-ranging eastern coyotes (Canis latrans; N?=?268), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes; N?=?63), and gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus; N?=?16) from Pennsylvania, USA, for antibodies (Abs) to CDV and CPV. This comprehensive screening was achieved using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based colorimetric assay. Abs to CDV and CPV were detected in 25.4% and 45.5% of coyotes, 36.5% and 52.4% of red foxes, and 12.5% and 68.8% of gray foxes, respectively. Abs to both viruses were detected in 9.7% of coyotes, 19.1% of red foxes, and 12.5% of gray foxes. This study demonstrates significant wildlife exposure in a northeastern state to CDV and CPV. As wildlife species continue to urbanize, the probability of spillover between domestic animals and wildlife will increase. Ongoing surveillance of wildlife for CDV and CPV exposure is warranted. IMPORTANCE Canine distemper virus (CDV) and Canine parvovirus (CPV) are significant health threats to domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) and wildlife. CDV and CPV have been identified in diverse vertebrates, including endangered wildlife species. Susceptibility to these viral pathogens varies significantly among geographic regions and between host species. High morbidity and mortality have been reported with infection by either virus in susceptible species, including dogs. As humans and companion animals encroach on wildlife habitat, and as wildlife becomes increasingly urbanized, the potential for transmission between species increases. This study assessed CPV and CDV Ab prevalence in wild canids (eastern coyotes, red foxes, and gray foxes) harvested in Pennsylvania between 2015 and 2020. High Ab prevalence was demonstrated for both viruses in each species. Ongoing monitoring of CPV and CDV in wildlife and increased efforts to vaccinate dogs and prevent spillover events are essential.",Journal Article,Microbiol Spectr,10,1,e0253221,"Animals;Animals, Wild/virology;Antibodies, Viral/blood;Coyotes/blood/*virology;Disease Reservoirs/*virology;Distemper Virus, Canine/classification/genetics/immunology/*isolation &;purification;Dog Diseases/transmission/*virology;Dogs;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Foxes/blood/*virology;Parvoviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary/virology;Parvovirus, Canine/classification/genetics/isolation & purification;Pennsylvania;*Canine distemper virus;*Canine parvovirus;*Pennsylvania;*coyote;*gray fox;*red fox;*wildlife",35080421,10.1128/spectrum.02532-21,2165-0497

This woman's sample exhibited neutralizing activity against SFTSV although she had neither a clear experience with tick bites nor SFTS-like clinical illness. These findings indicate that most people living in the endemic regions are not infected with SFTSV and suggest that most of the SFTS patients reported so far do not reflect the tip of an iceberg of people infected with SFTSV, but at the same time, that SFTSV infection does not always induce severe SFTS-associated symptoms.

During our sero-survey of SFTS virus (SFTSV) among veterinary professionals in 2018, a veterinarian and his assistant working in an animal hospital were tested positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An additional survey implied a cluster of SFTS cases in which four more people, a family who brought two sick dogs to the animal hospital in 2003, were involved. This study aimed at assessing the possibility of animal-to-human transmission of SFTSV in this cluster. METHODS: Retrospective interviews were performed with the owner family of the dogs and their clinical records were obtained from each hospital. SFTSV-IgG were tested by ELISA and virus neutralization test using the sera collected from them in 2018. RESULTS: The interviews revealed that a total of six people, the two veterinary professionals and the owner family who took care of the sick dogs, suffered from SFTS-like symptoms in the same period of time in 2003. All patients did not have tick bite before the onset and all suspected causative agents were excluded by laboratory tests. The serological tests in this study revealed the four owner family members were all positive for SFTSV antibodies.

A total of 147 humans and 897 rats were tested. METHODS: In addition to immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM serology and traditional reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), novel quantitative RT-PCR primers/probe were developed, and whole genome sequencing was performed. RESULTS: Seventeen people had SEOV IgM, indicating recent infection; 7 reported symptoms and 3 were hospitalized. All patients recovered. Thirty-one facilities in 11 US states had SEOV infection, and among those with ?10 rats tested, rat IgG prevalence ranged 2%-70% and SEOV RT-PCR positivity ranged 0%-70%. Human laboratory-confirmed cases were significantly associated with rat IgG positivity and RT-PCR positivity (P = .03 and P = .006, respectively). Genomic sequencing identified >99.5% homology between SEOV sequences in this outbreak, and these were >99% identical to SEOV associated with previous pet rat infections in England, the Netherlands, and France. Frequent trade of rats between home-based ratteries contributed to transmission of SEOV between facilities.

STLV-I exhibited greater overall sequence variation between strains (1 to 18% compared with 0 to 9% for HTLV-I), supporting the simian origin of the modern viruses in all species. Three HTLV-I phylogenetic clusters or clades (cosmopolitan, Zaire, and Melanesia) were resolved with phenetic, parsimony, and likelihood analytical procedures. Seven phylogenetic clusters of STLV-I were resolved with the most primitive (deeply rooted) divergence involving several STLV-I strains from Asian primate species. Combined analysis of HTLV-I and STLV-I revealed that neither STLV-I clusters nor HTLV-I clusters recapitulated host species specificity; rather, multiple clades from the same species were closer to clades from other species than to each other. We interpret these evolutionary associations as support for the occurrence of multiple discrete interspecies transmissions of ancestral viruses between primate species (including human) that led to recognizable phylogenetic clades that persist in modern species.

The primary hosts are mammalian species in the orders Carnivora and Chiroptera. Since the late 1980s, RABV has been isolated from non-human primates, Callithrix jacchus (the white-tufted marmoset), in four coastal states (Rio Grande do Norte, Cear?, Piau? and Pernambuco) in north-eastern Brazil, where this species is indigenous. The original habitat of C.ßjacchus consisted of two Brazilian biomes, the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga. However, these marmosets have since adapted to other ecosystems as a result of human activities. Between 1988 and 1989, RABV isolates were obtained from white-tufted marmosets in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, but antigenic and genetic identification studies were not conducted at that time. In the following years, three additional states reported cases (Cear?, Piau? and Pernambuco). In two of these states (Cear? and Piau?), human cases of rabies transmitted by marmosets were reported. According to Brazilian Health Ministry data, at least 19 human cases in which this species was the source of infection were registered in between 1990 and 2016. Recent findings in laboratory tests of 12 rabid samples from humans and marmosets and the regional transmission among these animals for over 20ßyears, together with the gradual increase in the affected geographic area, support the concept of the emergence of a new RABV reservoir. Regional tourism, the wild animal trade and the cultural practice of maintaining these animals as pets, particularly in coastal regions, appear to be major risk factors for the increase in human cases.

The etiological agent of this disease is the Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) which is closely related to the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and its range entirely lies within the TBEV area. OHFV belongs to the mammalian tick-borne flaviviruses and the ecological group of arboviruses. The problem concerning the origin of OHFV remains unresolved to date. This study analyzed all nucleotide sequences of the OHFV genome obtained in the present study and available in GenBank, including the E gene fragment and the amino acid sequences of the surface glycoprotein encoded by it. The conclusions, based on the clusteron approach, suggest that OHFV originated directly from the TBEV of the Far Eastern subtype due to the host-jump phenomenon, that is, through a rapid change from an arthropod host, Ixodes persulcatus, to a rodent, O. zibethicus. The muskrat was introduced to Western Siberia in the second half of the 1930s. The peculiarities of the biology and ecology of the muskrat in the new habitat became the reason for the TBEV cross-species transmission. Calculations show that host-jumping occurred between 1931 and 1947 and accompanied a cascade of adaptive amino acid substitutions in protein E. As a result, the virus changed its transmission to contact, alimentary, and airborne routes. Based on the data obtained, OHFV would be more correctly attributed to zoonotic viruses transmitted by rodents and, accordingly, to the ecological group of roboviruses.",Journal Article,J Med Virol,94,6,2510-2518,"Animals;*Arboviruses;Arvicolinae;*Encephalitis Viruses, Tick-Borne/genetics;*Encephalitis, Tick-Borne;Humans;Phylogeny;*Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus;*clusteron approach;*host-jump;*quantum evolution;*roboviruses;*tick-borne encephalitis virus",35001393,10.1002/jmv.27581,0146-6615

While pH1N1 is now considered to be in a post-pandemic stage in humans it has nevertheless spilled back into swine in at least 20 countries. Understanding the factors that increase the risk of spillover events between swine and humans is essential to predicting and preventing future outbreaks. We assessed risk factors that may have led to spillover of pH1N1 from humans to swine in Cameroon, Central Africa. We sampled swine, domestic poultry and wild birds for influenza A virus at twelve sites in Cameroon from December 2009 while the pandemic was ongoing, to August 2012. At the same time we conducted point-count surveys to assess the abundance of domestic livestock and wild birds and assess interspecific contact rates. Random forest models were used to assess which variables were the best predictors of influenza in swine. RESULTS: We found swine with either active pH1N1 infections or positive for influenza A at four of our 12 sites. Only one swine tested positive by competitive ELISA in 2011-2012. To date we have found pH1N1 only in the North and Extreme North regions of Cameroon (regions in Cameroon are administrative units similar to provinces), though half of our sites are in the Central and Western regions. Swine husbandry practices differ between the North and Extreme North regions where it is common practice in to let swine roam freely, and the Central and Western regions where swine are typically confined to pens. Random forest analyses revealed that the three best predictors of the presence of pH1N1 in swine were contact rates between free-ranging swine and domestic ducks, contact rates between free-ranging swine and wild Columbiformes, and contact rates between humans and ducks. Sites in which swine were allowed to range freely had closer contact with other species than did sites in which swine were kept penned.

Sixty-five AIVs that belong to four hemagglutination (HA) subtypes ofAIV (H3, H4, H6, and H9) were isolated from 644 pooled tissue or swab samples collected in LBMs. Most H9 subtypes of AIVs were isolated from Galliformes (chickens, silky fowls, pheasants, and guinea fowls), and other subtypes were isolated from Anseriformes (Pekin ducks and mallards). In addition, we obtained a single H3N2 virus from nasal swabs of dogs sold in LBMs, and the virus was genetically identical to the canine influenza virus (CIV) isolated from pet dogs in Korea. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Korean H9N2 viruses prevalent in chickens have provided their gene segments to AIVs circulating in ducks. These gene transfers facilitated reassortment events among AIVs and likely generated the ancestors of CIV in Korea. An animal challenge study using chickens, quail, mice, and dogs had shown that the H4 and H6 subtypes could replicate in mice and that some H4 and H6 viruses could replicate in chickens without preadaptation. In addition, two H3 subtype viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) induced interstitial pneumonia that accompanied clinical signs and seroconversion in dogs.

Analyses of proviral and viral RNA levels demonstrate that PLVA fitness is severely restricted in mountain lions compared to that in bobcats. We document evidence of diversifying selection in three of six PLVA genomes from mountain lions, but we did not detect selection among 20 PLVA isolates from bobcats. These findings support the hypothesis that PLVA is a bobcat-adapted virus which is less fit in mountain lions and under intense selection pressure in the novel host. Ancestral reconstruction of transmission events reveals that intraspecific PLVA transmission has occurred among panthers (Puma concolor coryi) in Florida following the initial cross-species infection from bobcats. In contrast, interspecific transmission from bobcats to mountain lions predominates in California. These findings document outcomes of cross-species lentiviral transmission events among felids that compare to the emergence of HIV from nonhuman primates.IMPORTANCE Cross-species transmission episodes can be singular, dead-end events or can result in viral replication and spread in the new species. The factors that determine which outcome will occur are complex, and the risk of new virus emergence is therefore difficult to predict. We used molecular techniques to evaluate the transmission, fitness, and adaptation of puma lentivirus A (PLVA) between bobcats and mountain lions in two geographic regions. Our findings illustrate that mountain lion exposure to PLVA is relatively common but does not routinely result in communicable infections in the new host. This is attributed to efficient species barriers that largely prevent lentiviral adaptation. However, the evolutionary capacity for lentiviruses to adapt to novel environments may ultimately overcome host restriction mechanisms over time and under certain ecological circumstances. This phenomenon provides a unique opportunity to examine cross-species transmission events leading to new lentiviral emergence.",Journal Article,J Virol,91,5,,"Animals;California/epidemiology;Cat Diseases/epidemiology/transmission/*virology;Cats;Female;Florida/epidemiology;Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*physiology;Lynx/*virology;Male;Phylogeny;Polymorphism, Genetic;Puma/*virology;Selection, Genetic;Species Specificity;Viral Tropism;*bobcat;*cross-species transmission;*feline;*feline immunodeficiency virus;*mountain lion;*retroviruses",28003486,10.1128/jvi.02134-16,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x

Only by identifying those host populations that are critical to the permanent maintenance of the pathogen, as opposed to populations in which outbreaks are the result of 'spillover' infections, can control measures be appropriately directed. Rabies virus is capable of infecting a wide range of host species, but in many ecosystems, particular variants circulate among only a limited range of potential host populations. The Serengeti ecosystem (in northwestern Tanzania) supports a complex community of wild carnivores that are threatened by generalist pathogens that also circulate in domestic dog populations surrounding the park boundaries. While the combined assemblage of host species appears capable of permanently maintaining rabies in the ecosystem, little is known about the patterns of circulation within and between these host populations. Here we use molecular phylogenetics to test whether distinct virus-host associations occur in this species-rich carnivore community. Our analysis identifies a single major variant belonging to the group of southern Africa canid-associated viruses (Africa 1b) to be circulating within this ecosystem, and no evidence for species-specific grouping. A statistical parsimony analysis of nucleoprotein and glycoprotein gene sequence data is consistent with both within- and between-species transmission events.

In turn, we investigated the circulation of mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), coronaviruses (CoVs) and astroviruses (AstVs) in pigs and bats sharing the same environment. Results of our preliminary study did not show any bat virus in pigs suggesting that spillover from these animals is rare. However, several AstVs, CoVs and MRVs circulated undetected in pigs. Among those, one MRV was a reassortant strain carrying viral genes likely acquired from bats. On the other hand, we found a swine AstV and a MRV strain carrying swine genes in bat guano, indicating that viral exchange at the bat-pig interface might occur more frequently from pigs to bats rather than the other way around.

Intensive enzootic activity among the hosts and vectors does not always lead to human outbreaks, as is the situation throughout much of the southeastern United States. In Georgia, substantial yearly evidence of WNV in the mosquito vectors and avian hosts since 2001 has only led to 324 human cases. Although virus has been consistently isolated from mosquitoes trapped in Atlanta, GA, little is known about viral activity among the passerine hosts. A possible reason for the suppression of WNV spillover to humans is that viremic birds are absent from high human-use areas of the city. To test this hypothesis, multiseason, multihabitat, longitudinal WNV surveillance for active WNV viremia was conducted within the avian host community of urban Atlanta by collection of blood samples from wild passerine birds in five urban microhabitats. WNV was isolated from the serum of six blood samples collected from 630 (0.95%) wild passerine birds in Atlanta during 2010-2012, a proportion similar to that found in the Chicago, IL, area in 2005, when over 200 human cases were reported. Most of the viremic birds were Northern Cardinals, suggesting they may be of particular importance to the WNV transmission cycle in Georgia. Results indicated active WNV transmission in all microhabitats of urban Atlanta, except in the old-growth forest patches. The number of viremic birds was highest in Zoo Atlanta, where 3.5% of samples were viremic. Although not significant, these observations may suggest a possible transmission reduction effect of urban old-growth forests and a potential role in WNV amplification for Zoo Atlanta.

In this study, we estimated the prevalence of HEV in Finnish cervid species that are commonly hunted for human consumption. We investigated sera from 342 European moose (Alces alces), 70 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and 12 European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus).

HEV seroprevalence was 9.1% (31/342) in moose and 1.4% (1/70) in white-tailed deer. None of the European roe deer were HEV seropositive (0/12). No HEV RNA was detected from samples of seropositive animals. HEV seropositive moose were detected in all districts. Statistically, HEV seroprevalence in moose was significantly higher (p?<?0.05) in the North-East area compared to the South-West area. The highest HEV seroprevalence (20.0%) in district level was more than six times higher than the lowest (3.1%).

To better understand the risks of influenza transmission at the human-animal interface, we evaluated 1) the rate of IAV detection in swine farmworkers before and after work during two human influenza seasons, 2) assessed risk factors associated with IAV detection in farmworkers and 3) characterized the genetic sequences of IAV detected in both workers and pigs. Of 58 workers providing nasal passage samples during 8-week periods during the 2017/18 and 2018/19 influenza seasons, 33 (57%) tested positive by rRT-PCR at least once. Sixteen (27%) workers tested positive before work and 24 (41%) after work.

Although farmworkers were more likely to test positive at the end of the working day (ORß=ß1.98, 95% CI 1.14-3.41), there were no influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms, or other risk indicators, associated with IAV detection before or after reporting to work. Direct whole-genome sequencing from samples obtained from worker nasal passages indicated evidence of infection of a worker with pandemic 2009 H1N1 of human-origin IAV (H1-pdm 1A 3.3.2) when reporting to work, and exposure of several workers to a swine-origin IAV (H1-alpha 1A 1.1) circulating in the pigs on the farm where they were employed. Our study provides evidence of 1) risk of IAV transmission between pigs and people, 2) pandemic H1N1 IAV infected workers reporting to work and 3) workers exposed to swine harbouring swine-origin IAV in their nasal passages temporarily.

STUDY DESIGN: Rotavirus G3P[3] was detected using a commercial immunoenzymatic assay, SDS-PAGE, and genotyped by RT-PCR. The analysis of the genetic relationship between human and animal rotaviruses was carried out by sequencing the VP7 and VP4 genes. RESULTS: The VP7 gene of the R2638 strain displayed the highest nucleotide identity to the canine strains A79-10 (96.6%) and CU-1 (96.2%) isolated in USA. The VP4 sequence showed the highest nucleotide identity to P[3] canine rotavirus strain RV52/96 isolated in Italy at 94.1%. Furthermore, the VP4 genes of P[3] strains could be discriminated into two phylogentically distinct clusters. CONCLUSION: The present study reinforces the hypothesis that animal's rotaviruses might be able to cross the species barriers, and the lack of systematic surveillance of rotavirus infection in small animals hinders the ability to establish firm epidemiologic connections. Moreover, in 2006 rotavirus vaccine was included in the Brazilian Immunization Program, and selective vaccine pressure could increase the circulation of uncommon strains. This is the first report of G3P[3] in over 20-year period of monitoring in Brazil.",Journal Article,J Clin Virol,54,1,89-92,"Animals;Antigens, Viral/genetics;Brazil;Capsid Proteins/genetics;Dog Diseases/*transmission/*virology;Dogs;Female;Humans;Infant;Molecular Sequence Data;RNA, Viral/genetics;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Rotavirus/*genetics/*isolation & purification;Rotavirus Infections/*veterinary/*virology;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Zoonoses/*virology",22398035,10.1016/j.jcv.2012.01.025,1386-6532

METHODS: Beginning in 2015, we used a One Health approach and serial sampling to prospectively study 299 swine workers and 100 controls, their 9000 pigs, and 6 pig farm environments in China for influenza A viruses (IAVs) using molecular, culture, and immunological techniques. Study participants were closely monitored for influenza-like illness (ILI) events. RESULTS: Upon enrollment, swine workers had higher serum neutralizing antibody titers against swine H1N1 and higher nasal wash total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and specific IgA titers against swine H1N1 and H3N2 viruses. Over a period of 12 months, IAVs were detected by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in 46 of 396 (11.6%) environmental swabs, 235 of 3300 (7.1%) pig oral secretion, 23 of 396 (5.8%) water, 20 of 396 (5.1%) aerosol, and 19 of 396 (4.8%) fecal-slurry specimens. Five of 32 (15.6%) participants with ILI events had nasopharyngeal swab specimens that were positive for IAV, and 17 (53.1%) demonstrated 4-fold rises in neutralization titers against a swine virus. Reassorted Eurasian avian-lineage H1N1, A(H1N1)pdm09-like, and swine-lineage H3N2 viruses were identified in pig farms. The A(H1N1)pdm09-like H1N1 viruses identified in swine were nearly genetically identical to the human H1N1 viruses isolated from the participants with ILI. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable evidence of A(H1N1)pdm09-like, swine-lineage H1N1, and swine-lineage H3N2 viruses circulating, likely reassorting, and likely crossing species within the pig farms.

In this paper, we report an incidence of rabid fox bites in a village in southern part of India involving 18 individuals, including 4 children. All people had category III exposures, including bites on the face and neck. The attacking fox was killed by the forest department and buried immediately. The victims of the fox bite did not receive appropriate and adequate postexposure treatment. Thirteen days after the bite, one of the bite victims developed typical symptoms of furious rabies and died 2 days later in a local hospital. His brain tissue, obtained at autopsy, was strongly positive for rabies by fluorescent antibody technique (FAT) and virus isolation. Panic prevailed in the community and the rest of the 17 cases were referred to our institute for advice and further management. Only 35% of them had protective levels of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (RVNA). All of the patients were administered with an 8-site intradermal regimen with purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) vaccine and were followed up regularly. All of them developed adequate titers (>0.5?IU/mL) of RVNA 7 days later. They were under regular follow-up and after nearly 2 years none have developed rabies. The partial Nucleoprotein (N) gene sequencing of the virus isolate from the patient who died of rabies had close homology with species I (prototype rabies) sequences available in GenBank and our own past isolates from dogs and humans, thus confirming that virus spillover from wildlife to domestic dogs continues to occur.

Complete genome sequences of both strains were analyzed in comparison with that of the representative porcine G4P[6] RVA strain (RVA/Pig-wt/THA/CMP-011-09/2009/G4P[6]) detected in the same geographical area. Human RVA strain CMH-N016-10 containing the genotype constellation of G4-P[6]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T1-E1-H1 was identical to that of porcine RVA strain CMP-011-09.

F.;Apetrei, C.;Pandrea, I.",2014,Pathogenic features associated with increased virulence upon Simian immunodeficiency virus cross-species transmission from natural hosts,"While simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) are generally nonpathogenic in their natural hosts, dramatic increases in pathogenicity may occur upon cross-species transmission to new hosts. Deciphering the drivers of these increases in virulence is of major interest for understanding the emergence of new human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). We transmitted SIVsab from the sabaeus species of African green monkeys (AGMs) to pigtailed macaques (PTMs). High acute viral replication occurred in all SIVsab-infected PTMs, yet the outcome of chronic infection was highly variable, ranging from rapid progression to controlled infection, which was independent of the dynamics of acute viral replication, CD4(+) T cell depletion, or preinfection levels of microbial translocation. Infection of seven PTMs with plasma collected at necropsy from a rapid-progressor PTM was consistently highly pathogenic, with high acute and chronic viral replication, massive depletion of memory CD4(+) T cells, and disease progression in all PTMs. The plasma inoculum used for the serial passage did not contain adventitious bacterial or viral contaminants. Single-genome amplification showed that this inoculum was significantly more homogenous than the inoculum directly derived from AGMs, pointing to a strain selection in PTMs. In spite of similar peak plasma viral loads between the monkeys in the two passages, immune activation/inflammation levels dramatically increased in PTMs infected with the passaged virus. These results suggest that strain selection and a massive cytokine storm are major factors behind increased pathogenicity of SIV upon serial passage and adaptation of SIVs to new hosts following cross-species transmission. IMPORTANCE: We report here that upon cross-species transmission and serial passage of SIVsab from its natural host, the sabaeus African green monkey (AGM), to a new host, the pigtailed macaque (PTM), viral adaptation and increased pathogenicity involve strain selection and a massive cytokine storm. These results permit the design of strategies aimed at preventing cross-species transmission from natural hosts of SIVs to humans in areas of endemicity. Furthermore, our study describes a new animal model for SIV infection. As the outcomes of SIVsab infection in PTMs, African green monkeys, and rhesus macaques are different, the use of these systems enables comparative studies between pathogenic, nonpathogenic, and elite-controlled infections, to gain insight into the mechanisms of SIV immunodeficiency and comorbidities.",Journal Article,J Virol,88,12,6778-92,Animals;CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology;Chlorocebus aethiops;HIV/genetics/pathogenicity/physiology;HIV Infections/immunology/transmission/virology;*Host Specificity;Humans;Macaca nemestrina;Serial Passage;Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*transmission/*virology;Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology;Virulence;Virus Replication,24696477,10.1128/jvi.03785-13,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x

Several reports also suggest that other species can be FV hosts. Since most of such studies involved livestock or companion animals, we aimed to test blood samples from wild ruminants for the presence of FV-specific antibodies and, subsequently, genetic material. Out of 269 serum samples tested by ELISA with the bovine foamy virus (BFV) Gag and Bet antigens, 23 sera showed increased reactivity to at least one of them. High reactive sera represented 30% of bison samples and 7.5% of deer specimens. Eleven of the ELISA-positives were also strongly positive in immunoblot analyses. The peripheral blood DNA of seroreactive animals was tested by semi-nested PCR.

Interactions between wild and domestic birds, humans and swine can lead to spillover events. Backyard livestock systems in proximity to wetlands represent high-risk areas for viral spread. However, some gaps remain in our knowledge of IAV transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface in Mexico. Hence, the study aimed at molecular identification and phylogenetic characterization of IAV in the wild duck-backyard livestock interface at a wetland of Mexico. A total of 875 animals were tested by real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). We detected IAV in 3.68% of the wild ducks sampled during the winter season 2016-2017. Nonetheless, the samples obtained from backyard poultry and swine tested negative. The highest IAV frequency (11.10%) was found in the Mexican duck (Anas diazi). Subtypes H1N1, H3N2 and H5N2 were detected. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that IAV detected in wild birds from the Lerma wetlands was mostly related to swine and poultry IAV strains previously isolated in the United States and Mexico. Except, the UIFMVZ377/H5N2 related to North American waterbirds. In conclusion, the co-circulation of three IAV subtypes in wild ducks close to backyard farms in Mexico, as well as the local identification of influenza viruses genetically related to Mexican and North American IAV strains, highlights the importance of the Lerma marshes for influenza surveillance given the close interaction among wild birds, poultry, pigs and humans.",Journal Article,Transbound Emerg Dis,68,6,3563-3573,"Animals;Animals, Wild;*Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype;Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype;*Influenza A Virus, H5N2 Subtype;*Influenza A virus/genetics;*Influenza in Birds/epidemiology;Livestock;Mexico/epidemiology;Phylogeny;Swine;*Swine Diseases/epidemiology;United States;backyard poultry;backyard swine;hunter-harvested wild ducks;phylogenetic analysis;qRT-PCR;the Lerma marshes",33350099,10.1111/tbed.13962,1865-1674

However, 3 and 5 genes of RV198-95 and RV52-96, respectively, were found in distinct subclusters of the same genotypes, suggesting the occurrence of reassortment events among strains belonging to this FRV/CRV/HRV genogroup. Detailed phylogenetic analyses of the HRV strain PA260-97 showed that (i) 8 genome segments (VP3, VP4, VP6, VP7 and NSP2-5) clustered closely with RV198-95 and/or RV52-96; (ii) 2 genome segments (VP1 and VP2) were more closely related to HRV AU-1; and (iii) 1 genome segment (NSP1) was distantly related to any other established NSP1 genotypes and was ratified as a new NSP1 genotype, A15. These findings suggest that the human strain PA260-97 has a history of zoonotic transmission and is likely a reassortant among FRV/CRV strains from the Cat97 and AU-1-like genogroups.

However, many aspects of the antibody response to natural infection are not well understood. Here, we assessed the immune response after H1N1 influenza virus infection in children and adults in a Nicaraguan household transmission study using an influenza virus protein microarray (IVPM). This technology allows us to simultaneously measure IgG and IgA antibody responses to hemagglutinins of many different virus strains and subtypes quantitatively with a high throughput. We found that children under 6?years of age responded to natural infection with a relatively narrow response that targeted mostly the hemagglutinin of the strain that caused the infection. Adults, however, have a much broader response, including a boost in antibodies to many group 1 subtype hemagglutinins. Also, a strong recall response against historic H1 hemagglutinins that share the K133 epitope with the pandemic H1N1 virus was observed. Of note, some children, while responding narrowly within H1 and group 1 hemagglutinins, induced a boost to H3 and other group 2 hemagglutinins when infected with H1N1 when they had experienced an H3N2 infection earlier in life. This is an interesting phenomenon providing evidence for immune imprinting and a significant new insight which might be leveraged in future universal influenza virus vaccine strategies. Finally, preexisting immunity to pandemic H1 hemagglutinins was significantly associated with protection from infection in both children and adults. In adults, preexisting immunity to non-H1 group 1 hemagglutinins was also significantly associated with protection from infection.IMPORTANCE It is known since Thomas Francis, Jr. published his first paper on original antigenic sin in 1960 that the first infection(s) with influenza virus leaves a special immunological imprint which shapes immune responses to future infections with antigenically related influenza virus strains. Imprinting has been implicated in both protective effects as well as blunting of the immune response to vaccines. Despite the fact that this phenomenon was already described almost 60?years ago, we have very little detailed knowledge of the characteristics and breadth of the immune response to the first exposure(s) to influenza virus in life and how this compares to later exposure as adults. Here, we investigate these immune responses in detail using an influenza virus protein microarray. While our findings are mostly descriptive in nature and based on a small sample size, they provide a strong basis for future large-scale studies to better understand imprinting effects.",Journal Article,mBio,11,1,,"Adult;Age Factors;Animals;Antibodies, Viral/*immunology;Antigens, Viral/immunology;Child;Cross Reactions;Humans;Immunoglobulin A/immunology;Immunoglobulin G/immunology;*Immunologic Memory;Influenza Vaccines/immunology;Influenza, Human/epidemiology/*immunology/*virology;Mice;Orthomyxoviridae/classification/*immunology;Phylogeny;Vaccination;*cross-reactivity;*heterosubtypic immunity;*imprinting;*influenza;*influenza virus;*natural infection",31964741,10.1128/mBio.03243-19,

The P and the subgroup (SG) specificities were determined by sequencing the VP4 and the VP6 gene, respectively. The PR/1300/04 strain exhibited P[14] and SGI specificities. By sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the VP4, VP6 and VP7 amplicons, the PR/1300/04 VP4 and VP6 genes were demonstrated to be of human rotavirus origin, with the VP4 gene closely related to the human Italian PA169 strain (G6P[14]), while the VP7 gene was of animal origin (bovine).

The present study describes the full-length genome analysis of two G8P[14] and one G10P[14] human RVAs detected in Italy. The strains possessed the typical bovine-like I2-R2-C2-M2-A3/A11-N2-T6-E2-H3 genotype constellation. All the segments of the two G8P[14] RVAs were most closely related to bovine(-like) strains but were relatively distant to each other, suggesting two independent interspecies transmission events. Likewise, the G10P[14] RVA gene segments were most similar to bovine(-like) RVAs but distinct from the G8 strains. The history of these strains probably involved the interspecies transmission of these viruses to humans from an as-yet-unidentified animal host, without evidence of reassortment events involving human RVAs.

In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that wolves are susceptible to CaKoV infections. A total of 185 wolf stool samples were collected from necropsied animals and from transects in the Liguria, Piemonte and Valle D'Aosta regions of Italy, and CaKoV RNA was identified in two of these specimens. Both samples were obtained from necropsied wolves, with a prevalence rate of 4.9% (2/41). Sequence analysis of the full-length VP1 region showed that these strains displayed the highest nucleotide (nt) sequence identity (86.3-98.5%) to canine strains identified in the UK and Africa, and to kobuviruses that were previously detected in other African wild carnivores.

HEV infection is known to have a zoonotic swine origin in industrialized countries. The role of pigs and wild boars as major reservoirs for human infection is today well-established; however, the list of new animal reservoirs is ever-expanding as new HEV strains are continuously being found in a broad host range. The recent detection of HEV in sheep stools brings concerns on the possibility of HEV transmission from these animals to humans, particularly in those occupationally exposed. The present work investigated the potential occupational risk of HEV infection in shepherds and sheep milk cheesemakers-workers occupationally exposed to ovine (WOEOs; Nß=ß96)-from a region of the Centre of Portugal ('Serra da Estrela') based on the differences of anti-HEV IgG seroprevalence rates between these professionals and the general population (Nß=ß192). The presence of HEV-specific antibodies in sheep (Nß=ß90) from the same region was also evaluated. The HEV seroprevalence in WOEOs (29.3%) was found to be significantly higher (pß=ß.0198) when compared with population controls (16.1%) which suggests an increased risk for HEV infection in these workers. HEV-specific antibodies were also found in 16.6% of the studied sheep showing that HEV circulates in these animals. Further studies are needed to confirm the zoonotic potential of sheep HEV.",Journal Article,Transbound Emerg Dis,,,,hepatitis E virus;occupational exposure;ovine;sheep;zoonoses,32090484,10.1111/tbed.13524,1865-1674

RVF is of global concern, having expanded its geographical range over the last decades. The impact of control measures on epidemic dynamics using empirical data has not been assessed. Here, we fitted a mathematical model to seroprevalence livestock and human RVF case data from the 2018-2019 epidemic in Mayotte to estimate viral transmission among livestock, and spillover from livestock to humans through both direct contact and vector-mediated routes. Model simulations were used to assess the impact of vaccination on reducing the epidemic size. The rate of spillover by direct contact was about twice as high as vector transmission. Assuming 30% of the population were farmers, each transmission route contributed to 45% and 55% of the number of human infections, respectively. Reactive vaccination immunizing 20% of the livestock population reduced the number of human cases by 30%. Vaccinating 1 mo later required using 50% more vaccine doses for a similar reduction. Vaccinating only farmers required 10 times as more vaccine doses for a similar reduction in human cases. Finally, with 52.0% (95% credible interval [CrI] [42.9-59.4]) of livestock immune at the end of the epidemic wave, viral reemergence in the next rainy season (2019-2020) is unlikely.

We analyze deep sequencing data from infected humans and domestic ducks in Cambodia to examine how H5N1 viruses evolve during spillover. Overall, viral populations in both species are predominated by low-frequency (<10%) variation shaped by purifying selection and genetic drift, and half of the variants detected within-host are never detected on the H5N1 virus phylogeny.

PB2 E627K and HA A150V were also enriched along phylogenetic branches leading to human infections, suggesting that they are likely human-adaptive. Our data show that H5N1 viruses generate putative human-adapting mutations during natural spillover infection, many of which are detected at >5% frequency within-host. However, short infection times, genetic drift, and purifying selection likely restrict their ability to evolve extensively during a single infection.

We investigated FIV and FeLV infection in free-ranging guignas (Leopardus guigna) and sympatric domestic cats in human perturbed landscapes on Chilo? Island, Chile. Samples from 78 domestic cats and 15 guignas were collected from 2008 to 2010 and analyzed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Two guignas and two domestic cats were positive for FIV; three guignas and 26 domestic cats were positive for FeLV. The high percentage of nucleotide identity of FIV and FeLV sequences from both species suggests possible interspecies transmission of viruses, facilitated by increased contact probability through human invasion into natural habitats, fragmentation of guigna habitat, and poultry attacks by guignas.

The passage of another simian retrovirus, simian foamy virus (SFV), from apes or monkeys to humans has been reported. Mandrillus sphinx, a monkey species living in central Africa, is naturally infected with SFV. We evaluated the natural history of the virus in a free-ranging colony of mandrills and investigated possible transmission of mandrill SFV to humans. RESULTS: We studied 84 semi-free-ranging captive mandrills at the Primate Centre of the Centre International de Recherches M?dicales de Franceville (Gabon) and 15 wild mandrills caught in various areas of the country. The presence of SFV was also evaluated in 20 people who worked closely with mandrills and other nonhuman primates. SFV infection was determined by specific serological (Western blot) and molecular (nested PCR of the integrase region in the polymerase gene) assays. Seropositivity for SFV was found in 70/84 (83%) captive and 9/15 (60%) wild-caught mandrills and in 2/20 (10%) humans. The 425-bp SFV integrase fragment was detected in peripheral blood DNA from 53 captive and 8 wild-caught mandrills and in two personnel. Sequence and phylogenetic studies demonstrated the presence of two distinct strains of mandrill SFV, one clade including SFVs from mandrills living in the northern part of Gabon and the second consisting of SFV from animals living in the south. One man who had been bitten 10 years earlier by a mandrill and another bitten 22 years earlier by a macaque were found to be SFV infected, both at the Primate Centre. The second man had a sequence close to SFVmac sequences. Comparative sequence analysis of the virus from the first man and from the mandrill showed nearly identical sequences, indicating genetic stability of SFV over time. CONCLUSION: Our results show a high prevalence of SFV infection in a semi-free-ranging colony of mandrills, with the presence of two different strains.

Therefore, considering the porcine-like or porcine origin of multiple gene segments, it might be tempting to assume that strain mcs/13-07 represents a rare instance of whole-virus transmission from pig to human, after which the virus evolved with time.

Due to close proximity of human and cattle in rural areas of developing countries like India, interspecies transmission or zoonotic transmission is a major source of rapid generation of reassortants and genetic or antigenic variants. Previously, many human group A rotaviruses were found with porcine or bovine characteristics from eastern and north-eastern India. In this study, four unusual human G8P[4] strains were identified which had artiodactyl-like origins. During an ongoing community based surveillance for epidemiological profiling of diarrheal pathogens, these unusual human group A rotavirus G8P[4] strains were detected from the stool samples of 3-14 months old children with acute diarrhea in Sonarpur, eastern India. Analysis of eleven complete and/or partial gene segments of these unusual G8P[4] strains were done by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) followed by nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.

We conducted a longitudinal, prospective study of 56 workers occupationally exposed to NWP in Brazil. Plasma from these workers was tested using Western blot (WB) assays containing NWP SFV antigens. Genomic DNA from blood and buccal swabs was analyzed for the presence of proviral SFV sequences by three nested PCR tests and a new quantitative PCR assay. Exposure histories were obtained and analyzed for associations with possible SFV infection. Ten persons (18%) tested seropositive and two persons were seroindeterminate (3.6%) for NWP SFV. Six persons had seroreactivity over 2-3 years suggestive of persistent infection. All SFV NWP WB-positive workers reported at least one incident involving NWP, including six reporting NWP bites. NWP SFV viral DNA was not detected in the blood or buccal swabs from all 12 NWP SFV seroreactive workers. We also found evidence of SFV seroreversion in three workers suggestive of possible clearance of infection.

Northward expansion of this epizootic included an outbreak in the Canadian province of Quebec in 2006-2009 due to trans-border spread from the State of Vermont. To inform a more proactive approach to future control efforts, this study uses phylogenetic analyses to explore the role of geography and alternative carnivore hosts in the dynamics of RRV spread within Vermont. Specifically, we sought to examine whether striped skunks, a species frequently infected by RRV, could be part of the maintenance host community. Whole genome sequencing of 160 RRV samples from Vermont and neighbouring US states were used for fine-scale phylogeographic analyses. Results, together with the complete surveillance record of raccoon rabies since its entry into Vermont in 1994, document incursions by two distinct viral lineages and identify topographical features of the landscape which have significantly influenced viral spread, resulting in a complex distribution pattern of viral variants throughout the state.

Infection with this virus causes severe illness and abortion in sheep, goats, and cattle as well as other domestic animals. Humans can also be exposed through close contact with infectious tissues or by bites from infected mosquitoes, primarily of the Aedes and Culex genuses. Although the cycle of RVFV infection in savannah regions is well documented, its distribution in forest areas in central Africa has been poorly investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To evaluate current circulation of RVFV among livestock and humans living in the Central African Republic (CAR), blood samples were collected from sheep, cattle, and goats and from people at risk, such as stock breeders and workers in slaughterhouses and livestock markets. The samples were tested for anti-RVFV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We also sequenced the complete genomes of two local strains, one isolated in 1969 from mosquitoes and one isolated in 1985 from humans living in forested areas. The 1271 animals sampled comprised 727 cattle, 325 sheep, and 219 goats at three sites. The overall seroprevalence of anti-RVFV IgM antibodies was 1.9% and that of IgG antibodies was 8.6%. IgM antibodies were found only during the rainy season, but the frequency of IgG antibodies did not differ significantly by season. No evidence of recent RVFV infection was found in 335 people considered at risk; however, 16.7% had evidence of past infection. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the strains isolated in the CAR with those isolated in other African countries showed that they belonged to the East/Central African cluster.

Strain ET8B exhibited a G5-P[13]-I5-R1-C1-M1-A8-N1-T7-E1-H1 genotype constellation that was identical to those of Brazilian porcine RVA G5P[13] strains RVA/Pig-wt/BRA/ROTA01/2013/G5P[13] and RVA/Pig-wt/BRA/ROTA07/2013/G5P[13], the only porcine G5P[13] RVAs that have been analyzed for the whole genome so far. Phylogenetically, all the 11 gene segments of ET8B were closely related to those of porcine and porcine-like human RVAs within the respective genotypes.

Interestingly, the VP2, VP3, VP6, VP7, and NSP1-NSP5 genes of simian RVA strain 08979 were closely related to those of porcine and porcine-like human RVA strains, exhibiting 99%-100% nucleotide sequence identities to cognate genes of co-circulating porcine RVA strain ET8B. On the other hand, the VP1 of 08979 appeared to be genetically divergent from porcine and human RVAs within the R1 genotype, and its exact origin could not be ascertained. Taken together, these observations suggested that simian strain 08979 might have been derived from interspecies transmission events involving transmission of ET8B-like RVAs from pigs to AGMs. In St. Kitts, AGMs often stray from the wild into livestock farms. Therefore, it may be possible that the AGM acquired the infection from a pig farm on the island. To our knowledge, this is the first report on detection of porcine-like RVAs in monkeys.

The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R(0) of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts.

S.",2020,A Heterogeneous Swine Show Circuit Drives Zoonotic Transmission of Influenza A Viruses in the United States,"Influenza pandemics are associated with severe morbidity, mortality, and social and economic disruption. Every summer in the United States, youths attending agricultural fairs are exposed to genetically diverse influenza A viruses (IAVs) circulating in exhibition swine, resulting in over 450 lab-confirmed zoonotic infections since 2010. Exhibition swine represent a small, defined population (?1.5% of the U.S. herd), presenting a realistic opportunity to mitigate a pandemic threat by reducing IAV transmission in the animals themselves. Through intensive surveillance and genetic sequencing of IAVs in exhibition swine in six U.S. states in 2018 (n?=?212), we characterized how a heterogeneous circuit of swine shows, comprising fairs with different sizes and geographic coverage, facilitates IAV transmission among exhibition swine and into humans. Specifically, we identified the role of an early-season national show in the propagation and spatial dissemination of a specific virus (H1?-2) that becomes dominant among exhibition swine and is associated with the majority of zoonotic infections in 2018. These findings suggest that a highly targeted mitigation strategy, such as postponing swine shows for 1 to 2?weeks following the early-season national show, could potentially reduce IAV transmission in exhibition swine and spillover into humans, and this merits further study.IMPORTANCE The varying influenza A virus (IAV) exposure and infection status of individual swine facilitates introduction, transmission, and dissemination of diverse IAVs. Since agricultural fairs bring people into intimate contact with swine, they provide a unique interface for zoonotic transmission of IAV. Understanding the dynamics of IAV transmission through exhibition swine is critical to mitigating the high incidence of variant IAV cases reported in association with agricultural fairs.

Through phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome sequences of influenza viruses of the H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 subtypes collected in swine in Brazil during 2009-2012, we identified multiple previously uncharacterized influenza viruses of human seasonal H1N2 and H3N2 virus origin that have circulated undetected in swine for more than a decade.

E.",2014,Introductions and evolution of human-origin seasonal influenza a viruses in multinational swine populations,"The capacity of influenza A viruses to cross species barriers presents a continual threat to human and animal health. Knowledge of the human-swine interface is particularly important for understanding how viruses with pandemic potential evolve in swine hosts. We sequenced the genomes of 141 influenza viruses collected from North American swine during 2002 to 2011 and identified a swine virus that possessed all eight genome segments of human seasonal A/H3N2 virus origin. A molecular clock analysis indicates that this virus--A/sw/Saskatchewan/02903/2009(H3N2)--has likely circulated undetected in swine for at least 7 years. For historical context, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of an additional 1,404 whole-genome sequences from swine influenza A viruses collected globally during 1931 to 2013. Human-to-swine transmission occurred frequently over this time period, with 20 discrete introductions of human seasonal influenza A viruses showing sustained onward transmission in swine for at least 1 year since 1965. Notably, human-origin hemagglutinin (H1 and H3) and neuraminidase (particularly N2) segments were detected in swine at a much higher rate than the six internal gene segments, suggesting an association between the acquisition of swine-origin internal genes via reassortment and the adaptation of human influenza viruses to new swine hosts. Further understanding of the fitness constraints on the adaptation of human viruses to swine, and vice versa, at a genomic level is central to understanding the complex multihost ecology of influenza and the disease threats that swine and humans pose to each other. IMPORTANCE: The swine origin of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic virus underscored the importance of understanding how influenza A virus evolves in these animals hosts. While the importance of reassortment in generating genetically diverse influenza viruses in swine is well documented, the role of human-to-swine transmission has not been as intensively studied. Through a large-scale sequencing effort, we identified a novel influenza virus of wholly human origin that has been circulating undetected in swine for at least 7 years. In addition, we demonstrate that human-to-swine transmission has occurred frequently on a global scale over the past decades but that there is little persistence of human virus internal gene segments in swine.",Journal Article,J Virol,88,17,10110-9,"Animals;*Evolution, Molecular;Genome, Viral;Humans;Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/*classification/genetics/*isolation &;purification;Influenza, Human/*transmission/*virology;Molecular Epidemiology;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology;RNA, Viral/genetics;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Swine;Swine Diseases/*virology",24965467,10.1128/jvi.01080-14,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x

Using spatio-temporal locations of cases, we applied logistic regression and Geographic Information System techniques to investigate environmental covariates driving occurrences of emerging rabies cases in Gauteng Province. About 53.8% of laboratory-confirmed lyssaviruses in Gauteng Province in 2016 originated from jackals. Phylogenetic trees reconstructed from a partial region of the glycoprotein gene of these and historical rabies viruses (RABVs) demonstrated the lyssaviruses to be of canid origin with 97.7% nucleotide sequence similarity. The major cluster comprised jackal RABVs from the 2012 KwaZulu/Natal outbreak and the 2016 outbreak in Gauteng Province. The second cluster was composed of both jackal and dog RABVs. Both clusters correlated with independent RABV introductions into Gauteng by dogs and jackals, respectively.

In this study, serum samples collected from 353 healthy Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) in Kalimantan Island, Indonesia, during the period from December 2005 to December 2006 were screened for filovirus-specific IgG antibodies using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant viral surface glycoprotein (GP) antigens derived from multiple species of filoviruses (5 EBOV and 1 MARV species). Here we show that 18.4% (65/353) and 1.7% (6/353) of the samples were seropositive for EBOV and MARV, respectively, with little cross-reactivity among EBOV and MARV antigens. In these positive samples, IgG antibodies to viral internal proteins were also detected by immunoblotting. Interestingly, while the specificity for Reston virus, which has been recognized as an Asian filovirus, was the highest in only 1.4% (5/353) of the serum samples, the majority of EBOV-positive sera showed specificity to Zaire, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, or Bundibugyo viruses, all of which have been found so far only in Africa. These results suggest the existence of multiple species of filoviruses or unknown filovirus-related viruses in Indonesia, some of which are serologically similar to African EBOVs, and transmission of the viruses from yet unidentified reservoir hosts into the orangutan populations.

We examine this question using sequence data from 13 'Serengeti' strains including five complete genomes obtained between 1993 and 2011. Phylogenetic and haplotype network analyses reveal that strains from noncanids during the epidemic were more closely related to each other than to those from domestic or wild canids. All noncanid 'Serengeti' strains during the epidemic encoded: (1) one novel substitution G134S in the CDV-V protein; and (2) theßrare amino acid combination 519I/549H at two sites under positive selection in the region of the CDV-H protein that binds to SLAM (CD 150) host cell receptors.

However, information on case frequencies, clinical courses, and detailed epidemiological analyses are still lacking. We report the occurrence of BoDV-1-associated encephalitis in cases submitted to the Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, Regensburg University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany, and provide a detailed description of newly identified cases of BoDV-1-induced encephalitis. METHODS: All brain tissues from 56 encephalitis cases from Bavaria, Germany, of putative viral origin (1999-2019), which had been submitted for virological testing upon request of the attending clinician and stored for stepwise diagnostic procedure, were systematically screened for BoDV-1 RNA. Two additional BoDV-1-positive cases were contributed by other diagnostic centres. Positive results were confirmed by deep sequencing, antigen detection, and determination of BoDV-1-reactive antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical and epidemiological data from infected patients were collected and analysed. FINDINGS: BoDV-1 RNA and bornavirus-reactive antibodies were detected in eight newly analysed encephalitis cases and the first human BoDV-1 isolate was obtained from an unequivocally confirmed human BoDV-1 infection from the endemic area. Six of the eight BoDV-1-positive patients had no record of immunosuppression before the onset of fatal disease, whereas two were immunocompromised after solid organ transplantation. Typical initial symptoms were headache, fever, and confusion, followed by various neurological signs, deep coma, and severe brainstem involvement. Seven of nine patients with fatal encephalitis of unclear cause were BoDV-1 positive within one diagnostic centre. BoDV-1 sequence information and epidemiological analyses indicated independent spillover transmissions most likely from the local wild animal reservoir. INTERPRETATION: BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions.

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis and genotyping with G-(VP7) and P-specific (VP4) typing primers suggested that 13 of the 15 samples contained more than 11 segments and/or mixed G/P genotypes. Full-length amplicons for each segment were generated using RVA-specific primers and sequenced using the Ion Torrent and/or Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing platforms. Sequencing detected at least one segment in each sample for which duplicate sequences, often having distinct genotypes, existed. This supported and extended the PAGE and RT-PCR genotyping findings that suggested these samples were collected from individuals that had mixed rotavirus infections. The study reports the first porcine (MRC-DPRU1567) and bovine (MRC-DPRU3010) mixed infections. We also report a unique genome segment 9 (VP7), whose G9 genotype belongs to lineage VI and clusters with porcine reference strains. Previously, African G9 strains have all been in lineage III. Furthermore, additional RVA segments isolated from humans have a clear evolutionary relationship with porcine, bovine and ovine rotavirus sequences, indicating relatively recent interspecies transmission and reassortment. Thus, multiple RVA strains from sub-Saharan Africa are infecting mammalian hosts with unpredictable variations in their gene segment combinations. Whole-genome sequence analyses of mixed RVA strains underscore the considerable diversity of rotavirus sequences and genome segment combinations that result from a complex evolutionary history involving multiple host species.",Journal Article,Infect Genet Evol,31,,321-34,"Africa South of the Sahara;Animal Diseases/*virology;Animals;Cattle;Child, Preschool;*Coinfection;*Genome, Viral;Genotype;Humans;Infant;Infant, Newborn;Phylogeny;Rotavirus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification;Rotavirus Infections/epidemiology/*virology;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Swine;Africa;Mixed infections;Reassortants;Rotavirus;Whole genome;was declared.",25701122,10.1016/j.meegid.2015.02.011,1567-1348 (Print);1567-1348

Currently, MERS-CoV is classified by the WHO as having high pandemic potential requiring greater surveillance. Previous studies of MERS-CoV in Kenya mainly focused on site-specific and archived camel and human serum samples for antibodies. We conducted active nationwide cross-sectional surveillance of camels and humans in Kenya, targeting both nasal swabs and plasma samples from 1,163 camels and 486 humans collected from January 2016 to June 2018.

This study investigates the evolutionary epidemiology of SAT1 and SAT2 FMDV in Eastern Africa, as well as between cattle and wild African buffalo. Bayesian phylodynamic models were used to analyse SAT1 and SAT2 VP1 gene segments collected between 1975 and 2016, focusing on the SAT1 and SAT2 viruses currently circulating in Eastern Africa. The root state posterior probabilities inferred from our analyses suggest Zimbabwe as the ancestral location for SAT1 currently circulating in Eastern Africa (pß=ß0.67). For the SAT2 clade, Kenya is inferred to be the ancestral location for introduction of the virus into other countries in Eastern Africa (pß=ß0.72). Salient (Bayes factor >10) viral dispersal routes were inferred from Tanzania to Kenya, and from Kenya to Uganda for SAT1 and SAT2, respectively. Results suggest that cattle are the source of the SAT1 and SAT2 clades currently circulating in Eastern Africa. In addition, our results suggest that the majority of SAT1 and SAT2 in livestock come from other livestock rather than wildlife, with limited evidence that buffalo serve as reservoirs for cattle. Insights from the present study highlight the role of cattle movements and anthropogenic activities in shaping the evolutionary history of SAT1 and SAT2 in Eastern Africa.

First described in Kenya, it has spread to many African countries and beyond. In humans, it is sometimes misdiagnosed because the symptoms resemble those of influenza and/or malaria. Butchers, abattoir workers, and livestock keepers have the highest risk of infection. METHODOLOGY: In this study, serum samples collected between February and September 2019 from 196 individuals comprising of butchers (n = 121), abattoir/slaughterhouse workers (n = 55), and livestock keepers (n = 20) in Benue, Sokoto, and Borno States of northern Nigeria were screened using a commercial ELISA that detected anti-RVFV IgM and IgG alike (i.e., without discrimination). Data from administered questionnaires and the ELISA results were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (19.9%) of the 196 samples were positive for RVFV antibodies. The distribution by states showed that 17.4% (8/46), 21.7% (15/69), and 19.8% (16/81) of samples from Benue, Sokoto, and Borno States were seropositive, respectively. Additionally, 21.5% (26/121) butchers, 16.4% (9/55) abattoir workers, and 20% (4/20) livestock keepers were seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide serological evidence for exposure of occupationally at-risk individuals in northern Nigeria to RVFV. The higher seropositivity obtained in Sokoto and Borno states could be due to contact of these individuals with infected animal blood/tissues, aborted fetuses, and unhindered transboundary movement of animals and animal products into these states which share international borders with Niger, Chad, and Cameroon where evidences of RVFV infections were recently reported.",Journal Article,J Infect Dev Ctries,16,5,881-887,Animals;Humans;Kenya;Livestock;Nigeria/epidemiology;*Rift Valley fever virus;Zoonoses/epidemiology;*Nigeria;*antibodies;*occupationally exposed individuals,35656961,10.3855/jidc.15367,1972-2680

A total of 7 Asian marmots from a small zoological garden in Switzerland were found dead in hibernation during a routine check in the winter of 2011. The marmots died in February 2011. No clinical signs of disease were observed at any time. The viruses were detected in all individuals for which the tissues were available (n = 3). Detection of the viruses was performed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The most consistent gross lesion was a neck and thorax edema.

Numerous large intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were seen in the epithelial cells of the pharynx, of the airways, and in the skin keratinocytes. Brain lesions were limited to mild multifocal gliosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the marmot CDV strain was closely related to the clusters of CDVs detected in Switzerland in wild carnivores during a local outbreak in 2002 and the 2009-2010 nationwide epidemic, suggesting a spillover of this virus from wildlife.

In the Arctic, the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) is regarded as the principal reservoir, but there is considerable debate about how the disease persists at the low population densities that are typical for this species. We describe an outbreak of rabies among Arctic foxes and Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) during 2011-12 on the remote Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, an area with a very low and relatively stable Arctic fox density. The aim of the research was to increase knowledge of Arctic rabies in this ecosystem and in the presumed spillover host, the Svalbard reindeer. Phylogenetic analysis of rabies virus (RABV) RNA isolates from Arctic fox and reindeer was performed, and clinical observations and histologic and immunohistochemical findings in reindeer were described. An ongoing capture-mark-recapture project allowed collection of serum samples from clinically healthy reindeer from the affected population for detection of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies. The outbreak was caused by at least two different variants belonging to the RABV Arctic-2 and Arctic-3 clades, which suggests that rabies was introduced to Svalbard on at least two different occasions. The RABV variants found in Arctic fox and reindeer were similar within locations, suggesting that Arctic foxes and reindeer acquired the infection from the same source(s). The histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings in 10 reindeer were consistent with descriptions in other species infected with RABV of non-Arctic lineages.

The rotavirus genome is composed of eleven segments of double-stranded RNA and can undergo genetic reassortment during mixed infections, leading to progeny viruses with novel or atypical phenotypes. There are numerous descriptions of rotavirus strains isolated from human and animals that share genetic and antigenic features of viruses from heterologous species. In many cases, genetic analysis by hybridization has clearly demonstrated the genetic relatedness of gene segments to those from viruses isolated from different species. Together with the observation that some virus strains appear to have been transmitted to a different species as a whole genome constellation, these data suggest that interspecies transmission occurs naturally, albeit at low frequencies. Although interspecies transmission has not been documented directly, there is an increasing number of reports of atypical rotaviruses that are apparently derived from transmission between: humans, cats and dogs; humans and cattle; humans and pigs; pigs and cattle; and pigs and horses.

Here, the epidemiology of viruses circulating among backyard poultry in Vientiane Province was assessed to guide future control strategies. Oral/tracheal and cloacal swabs, collected from 605 poultry (308 ducks, 297 chickens) between 2011 and 2015, were screened by PCR for Newcastle disease virus (NDV), coronavirus (CoV) and chicken anaemia virus (CAV). Chicken sera were screened for anti-NDV antibodies by ELISA. Statistical and phylogenetic analyses revealed transmission patterns and relationships. Closely related strains co-circulated in chickens and ducks. While CoV RNA was detected in oral/tracheal swabs of 9.3% of the chickens and 2.4% of the ducks, rates were higher in faecal swabs of both species (27.3% and 48.2%). RNA of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and duck CoV was found in faecal swabs of chickens (19.7% and 7.1%) and ducks (4.1% and 44.1%). Moreover, DNA of the generally chicken-specific CAV was detected in oral/tracheal swabs of chickens (18.1%) and, sporadically, of ducks (2.4%). Despite serological evidence of NDV circulation or vaccination (86.9%), NDV RNA was not detected. We found a high prevalence and indication for cross-species transmission of different CoV strains in backyard poultry. Interestingly, ducks served as biological, or at least mechanical, carriers of viral strains closely related not only to IBV, but also to CAV. Bird containment and poultry species separation could be first steps to avoid cross-species transmission and emergence of novel strains with broad host range and enhanced pathogenicity.

To determine the evolutionary pressures on viruses in new host species, we evaluated the molecular evolution of a feline immunodeficiency virus derived from a wild cougar, Puma concolor, during infection of domestic cats. Analyses were based on the coding portion of genome sequences recovered at intervals over 37 weeks of infection of six cats inoculated by either intravenous or oral-nasal routes. All cats inoculated intravenously, but only one inoculated orally-nasally, became persistently viremic. There were notable accumulations of lethal errors and predominance of G-to-A alterations throughout the genome, which were marked in the viral polymerase gene, pol. Viral structural (env and gag) and accessory (vif and orfA) genes evolved neutrally or were under purifying selection. However, sites under positive selection were identified in reverse transcriptase that involved residues in the nucleotide binding pocket or those contacting the RNA-DNA duplex. The findings of extensive G-to-A alterations in this cross-species infection are consistent with the recently described editing of host cytidine deaminase on lentivirus genomes.

Humans can also be infected through direct contact with blood (aerosols) or tissues (placenta, stillborn) of infected animals. Although severe clinical cases can be observed, infection with RVF virus (RVFV) in humans is, in most cases, asymptomatic or causes a febrile illness without serious symptoms. In small ruminants RVFV mainly causes abortion and neonatal death. The distribution of RVFV has been well documented in many African countries, particularly in the north (Egypt, Sudan), east (Kenya, Tanzania, Somalia), west (Senegal, Mauritania) and south (South Africa), but also in the Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mayotte) and the Arabian Peninsula. In contrast, the prevalence of RVFV has rarely been investigated in central African countries. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We therefore conducted a large serological survey of rural populations in Gabon, involving 4,323 individuals from 212 randomly selected villages (10.3% of all Gabonese villages). RVFV-specific IgG was found in a total of 145 individuals (3.3%) suggesting the wide circulation of Rift Valley fever virus in Gabon. The seroprevalence was significantly higher in the lakes region than in forest and savannas zones, with respective rates of 8.3%, 2.9% and 2.2%. In the lakes region, RVFV-specific IgG was significantly more prevalent in males than in females (respectively 12.8% and 3.8%) and the seroprevalence increased gradually with age in males but not in females. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Although RVFV was suggested to circulate at a relatively high level in Gabon, no outbreaks or even isolated cases have been documented in the country. The higher prevalence in the lakes region is likely to be driven by specific ecologic conditions favorable to certain mosquito vector species. Males may be more at risk of infection than females because they spend more time farming and hunting outside the villages, where they may be more exposed to mosquito bites and infected animals. Further investigations are needed to determine the putative sylvan cycle of RVFV, including the mosquito species and the reservoir role of wild animals in the viral maintenance cycle.",Journal Article,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,4,7,e763,"Adolescent;Adult;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Animals;Antibodies, Viral/*blood;Female;Gabon/epidemiology;Humans;Immunoglobulin G/blood;Male;Middle Aged;Rift Valley Fever/*epidemiology;Rift Valley fever virus/*immunology;*Rural Population;Seroepidemiologic Studies;Young Adult",20668541,10.1371/journal.pntd.0000763,1935-2727 (Print);1935-2727

Here, we describe a molecular epidemiological investigation in a small company with eight employees of whom five contracted hantavirus infections in late 2017. Standardized interviews with employees were conducted to assess the circumstances under which the disease cluster occurred, how the employees were exposed and which counteractive measures were taken. Initially, two employees were admitted to hospital and serologically diagnosed with hantavirus infection. Subsequently, further investigations were conducted. By means of a self-administered questionnaire, three additional symptomatic cases could be identified. The hospital patients' sera were investigated and revealed in one patient a partial PUUV L segment sequence, which was identical to PUUV sequences from several bank voles collected in close proximity to company buildings. This investigation highlights the importance of a One Health approach that combines efforts from human and veterinary medicine, ecology and public health to reveal the origin of hantavirus disease clusters.",Journal Article,Zoonoses Public Health,69,5,579-586,Animals;Arvicolinae;Disease Outbreaks;*Hantavirus/genetics;*Hantavirus Infections/epidemiology/veterinary;*Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome/epidemiology/veterinary;Humans;*Puumala virus;*Rodent Diseases/epidemiology;* Clethrionomys glareolus;* Puumala orthohantavirus;*One Health initiative;*hantavirus outbreak;*occupational exposure,35312223,10.1111/zph.12940,1863-1959

Generally these sporadic events are evolutionary dead-ends, but occasionally, viruses establish themselves in a new host that offers a novel genomic context to which the virus must adjust to avoid attenuation. However, the dynamics of this process are unknown. Here we present a novel method to characterize the time it takes to G+C composition at third codon positions (GC3 content) of influenza viruses to adjust to that of a new host. We compare the inferred dynamics in two subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2, based on complete genomes of viruses circulating in humans, swine and birds between 1900-2009. Our results suggest that both subtypes have the same fast-adjusting genes, which are not necessarily those with the highest absolute rates of evolution, but those with the most relaxed selective pressures. Our analyses reveal that NA and NS2 genes adjust the fastest to a new host and that selective pressures of H3N2 viruses are relaxed faster than for H1N1. The asymmetric nature of these processes suggests that viruses with the greatest adjustment potential to humans are coming from both birds and swine for H3N2, but only from birds for H1N1.",Journal Article,PLoS One,8,12,e82486,"Animals;Humans;Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/*genetics;Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype/*genetics;Influenza, Human/*transmission/virology;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/*transmission/virology;Swine;Swine Diseases/*transmission/virology",24358190,10.1371/journal.pone.0082486,1932-6203

We present the first evidence of influenza A virus infection in household dogs in Mexico. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs. METHODS: Serum samples from household dogs and their owners were analyzed to detect the presence of antibodies against three subtypes of human influenza virus (H1N1pdm09, H1N1, and H3N2), as well as subtype H3N8 of equine influenza. We analyzed dog nasal exudates to detect influenza viral RNA. The relationship between the seropositivity of dogs and various factors (age, sex, constantly at home, and seropositivity of owners) was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Seroprevalence for human influenza in dogs was 0?9% (1 of 113), and it was 4% (5 of 113) for equine influenza. In humans, seroprevalence was 22% for subtype H1N1pdm09, 20% for subtype H1N1, and 11% for subtype H3N2. No significant association (P>0?05) was found between seropositivity and any of the assessed factors. Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected in the nasal exudate samples.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a cross-sectional seroepidemiological survey in Anchorage and western Alaska to identify possible behaviors associated with migratory bird exposure and measure seropositivity to HPAI H5N1. METHODS: We enrolled rural subsistence bird hunters and their families, urban sport hunters, wildlife biologists, and a comparison group without bird contact. We interviewed participants regarding their exposures to wild birds and collected blood to perform serologic testing for antibodies against a clade 2.2 HPAI H5N1 virus strain. RESULTS: Hunters and wildlife biologists reported exposures to wild migratory birds that may confer risk of infection with avian influenza A viruses, although none of the 916 participants had evidence of seropositivity to HPAI H5N1.

However, the relative importance of this last process in shaping the evolutionary history of hantaviruses remains uncertain, given the present limited knowledge not only of virus-host relationships but also of the pathogen and reservoir phylogenies. In South America, more than 25 hantavirus genotypes were detected; several of them act as aetiological agents of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). An understanding of the diversity of hantaviruses and of the processes underlying host switching is critical since human cases of HPS are almost exclusively the result of human-host interactions. In this study, we tested if preferential host switching is the main process driving hantavirus diversification in South America, by performing a co-phylogenetic analysis of the viruses and their primary hosts. We also suggest a new level of amino acid divergence to define virus species in the group.

L.;Keenliside, J.;Webby, R.;Fonseca, K.;Singh, P.;Moss, L.;Loeb, M.",2009,Protocol: transmission and prevention of influenza in Hutterites: zoonotic transmission of influenza A: swine & swine workers,"BACKGROUND: Among swine, reassortment of influenza virus genes from birds, pigs, and humans could generate influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Humans with acute infection might also be a source of infection for swine production units. This article describes the study design and methods being used to assess influenza A transmission between swine workers and pigs. We hypothesize that transmission of swine influenza viruses to humans, transmission of human influenza viruses to swine, and reassortment of human and swine influenza A viruses is occurring. The project is part of a Team Grant; all Team Grant studies include active surveillance for influenza among Hutterite swine farmers in Alberta, Canada. This project also includes non-Hutterite swine farms that are experiencing swine respiratory illness. METHODS/DESIGN: Nurses conduct active surveillance for influenza-like-illness (ILI), visiting participating communally owned and operated Hutterite swine farms twice weekly. Nasopharyngeal swabs and acute and convalescent sera are obtained from persons with any two such symptoms. Swabs are tested for influenza A and B by a real time RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) at the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). Test-positive participants are advised that they have influenza. The occurrence of test-positive swine workers triggers sampling (swabbing, acute and convalescent serology) of the swine herd by veterinarians. Specimens obtained from swine are couriered to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN for testing. Veterinarians and herd owners are notified if animal specimens are test-positive for influenza. If swine ILI occurs, veterinarians obtain samples from the pigs; test-positives from the animals trigger nurses to obtain specimens (swabbing, acute and convalescent serology) from the swine workers. ProvLab cultures influenza virus from human specimens, freezes these cultures and human sera, and ships them to St. Jude where sera will be examined for antibodies to swine and human influenza virus strains or reassortants. Full length sequencing of all eight genes from the human and swine influenza isolates will be performed so that detailed comparisons can be performed between them.

Dietary habits such as the consumption of forest undergrowth products and wild game meat, and the way of those products being prepared (in the process of barbequing) pose a risk factors of infection with the foodborne pathogens such as Echinococcus multilocularis, Trichinella spp., and HEV. AIM: The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of infections caused by Trichinella spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, and HEV in the population of Polish hunters, describing their geographical distribution in Poland, and to try to define basic factors, which may contribute to their occurrence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2010-2012 a cross-sectional study was carried out among Polish hunters. A blood samples were collected as well as a survey of 1027 participants recruited in the 16 provinces was also carried out. Serological tests were performed for the presence of specific antibodies against Echinococcus multilocularis, Trichinella spp. and HEV using commercial or ""in home"" ELISA tests. In case of positive result for Echinococcus, an Em2plus ELISA or/and western blot test were carried out, and for positive results for IgM for HEV a recomLine HEV IgM test was carried out. RESULTS: In the studied population a total number of 2 cases of Echinococcus multilocularis infection were found.

Comparative phylogenetic analyses based on 140 bp sequence of the pol gene indicate that these STLV-I isolates were 0-9% divergent from each other and were 3.5-7% divergent from the prototype related human retrovirus HTLV-I (ATK). The West African STLV-I isolates formed a unique phylogenetic cluster as did most of the Central African STLV-I isolates, save for STLV-I (Tan 90). The phylogenetic data indicate that cross species transmission of HTLV-I and STLV-I continued to occur long after their ancestral strain separated from the progenitor to HTLV-II.

Potential association of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in patients with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome has attracted broad interests in this topic. Although recent studies have indicated that XMRV is unlikely a human pathogen, further understanding of XMRV xenoinfection would allow in vivo modeling of the initial steps of gammaretroviral interspecies transmission, evolution and dissemination in a new host population. In this study, we monitored the long-term consequences of XMRV infection and its possible vertical transmission in a permissive foreign host, wild-derived Mus pahari mice. One year post-infection, XMRV-infected mice showed no notable pathological changes, while proviral DNA was detected in three out of eight mice. XMRV-infected mice remained seropositive throughout the study although the levels of gp70 Env- and p30 capsid-specific antibodies gradually decreased. When vertical XMRV transmission was assessed, no viremia, humoral immune responses nor endogenization were observed in nine offspring from infected mothers, yet one offspring was found PCR-positive for XMRV-specific sequences. Amplified viral sequences from the offspring showed several mutations, including one amino acid deletion in the receptor binding domain of Env SU. Our results therefore demonstrate long-term asymptomatic infection, low incidence of vertical transmission and limited evolution of XMRV upon transspecies infection of a permissive new host, Mus pahari.",Journal Article,PLoS One,7,1,e29682,"Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Antibodies, Viral/blood/immunology;DNA, Viral/blood;Female;Gene Products, env/chemistry/metabolism;HEK293 Cells;Humans;Immunity, Humoral;*Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical;Male;Mice;Mothers;Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*transmission;Time Factors;Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus/immunology/*pathogenicity",22235324,10.1371/journal.pone.0029682,1932-6203

An EriCoV-specific BRYT-Green½ real-time reverse transcription PCR assay was used to test 351 samples of faeces or distal large intestinal tract contents collected from casualty or dead hedgehogs from a wide area across GB. Viral RNA was detected in 10.8% (38) samples; however, the virus was not detected in any of the 61 samples tested from Scotland. The full genome sequence of the British EriCoV strain was determined using next generation sequencing; it shared 94% identity with a German EriCoV sequence.

Pestiviruses infect domestic animals such as pig, cattle, sheep, goats and many other wild ungulates. Cross-species transmission of pestiviruses between wildlife and domestic livestock is a subject of recent concern where wild ungulates are in close contact with domestic ruminants. The International Committee on Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) has named the genus Pestivirus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family, using the format Pestivirus A, Pestivirus B, Pestivirus C, and so on. Pestivirus A-D replaces Bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1), Bovine viral diarrhea virus-2 (BVDV-2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Border disease virus (BDV) respectively. During the 2013-2014 hunting season, a total of 40 samples were collected from wild boars (Sus scrofa ferus) in the area of Western Mediterranean Turkey. In the samples, nucleic acids were investigated for pestivirus, Aujeszky's disease virus, Borna disease virus, coronavirus, mastadenovirus and rotavirus. RT-PCR was performed using primary sets to detect specific partial gene region specific to each virus. Sequence analysis was performed on a positive sample. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the positive sample, TR/Burdur/13/Boar3, belonged to BDV genotype 1 (Pestivirus D).

The present study examined G/P combinations and genetic characteristics of RVAs in diarrheic bovine calves in Western India. RVAs were detected in 27 samples (17.64%) with a predominance of G10P[11] (51.85%), followed by previously unreported genomic constellations, G6P[14] (14.81%), and, G6P[4] (7.40%) and G10P[33] (3.70%).

The predominant G10P[11] strains were typical bovine strains and exhibited genotypic homogeneity. The rare, G10P[33] strain, had VP7 and VP4 genes of bovine origin but, a resemblance of the VP6 gene with simian strain indicated possible reassortment between bovine and simian (SA11-like) strains. The VP6 and VP7 genes of two rare strains, G6P[14] and G6P[4], were identical to those of bovine stains, but the VP4 was closely related to those of the human-bovine like and human strains, respectively. Additionally, in the VP4 gene phylogenetic tree, Indian P[14] strains constituted a closely related genetic cluster distinct from the other P[14] strains. Hence Lineage-8 was proposed for them. These findings indicated that bovines could serve as a source for anthropozoonotic transmission of G6P[14] strains while zooanthroponotic transmission followed by reassortment with human strain gave rise to G6P[4] strains.

Based on serological investigation, reverse transcriptase PCR, and subsequent sequence analysis of partial small (S) and medium (M) segments, we herein show that TULV is carried not only by its commonly known host M. arvalis but also frequently by M. agrestis in different regions of Germany for a prolonged time period. At one trapping site, TULV was exclusively detected in M. agrestis, suggesting an isolated transmission cycle in this rodent reservoir separate from spillover infections of TULV-carrying M. arvalis. Phylogenetic analysis of the S and M segment sequences demonstrated geographical clustering of the TULV sequences irrespective of the host, M. arvalis or M. agrestis. The novel TULV lineages from northeast, northwest, and southeast Germany described here are clearly separated from each other and from other German, European, or Asian lineages, suggesting their stable geographical localization and fast sequence evolution. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that TULV represents a promiscuous hantavirus with a large panel of susceptible hosts.

Due to low numbers and their solitary and reclusive nature, tiger sightings across their range in the Russian Far East and China are rare; sightings of sick tigers are rarer still. Serious neurologic disease observed in several wild tigers since 2001 suggested disease emergence in this endangered species. To investigate this possibility, histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were performed on tissues from 5 affected tigers that died or were destroyed in 2001, 2004, or 2010. Our results reveal canine distemper virus (CDV) infection as the cause of neurologic disease in two tigers and definitively establish infection in a third. Nonsuppurative encephalitis with demyelination, eosinophilic nuclear viral inclusions, and positive immunolabeling for CDV by IHC and ISH were present in the two tigers with available brain tissue. CDV phosphoprotein (P) and hemagglutinin (H) gene products were obtained from brains of these two tigers by RT-PCR, and a short fragment of CDV P gene sequence was detected in lymph node tissue of a third tiger. Phylogenetically, Amur tiger CDV groups with an Arctic-like strain in Baikal seals (Phoca siberica). Our results, which include mapping the location of positive tigers and recognition of a cluster of cases in 2010, coupled with a lack of reported CDV antibodies in Amur tigers prior to 2000 suggest wide geographic distribution of CDV across the tiger range and recent emergence of CDV as a significant infectious disease threat to endangered Amur tigers in the Russian Far East. IMPORTANCE: Recognition of disease emergence in wildlife is a rare occurrence. Here, for the first time, we identify and characterize a canine distemper virus (CDV), the second most common cause of infectious disease death in domestic dogs and a viral disease of global importance in common and endangered carnivores, as the etiology of neurologic disease and fatal encephalitis in wild, endangered Amur tigers. We establish that in 2010 CDV directly or indirectly killed -1% of Amur tigers. Location of positive cases over an expansive geographic area suggests that CDV is widely distributed across the tiger range. Interspecies interactions are increasing as human populations grow and expand into wildlife habitats. Identifying animal reservoirs for CDV and identifying the CDV strains that are transmissible to and among wildlife species, including Amur tigers and sympatric critically endangered Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis), is essential for guiding conservation and mitigation efforts.",Journal Article,mBio,4,4,,"Animals;Cluster Analysis;Communicable Diseases, Emerging/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary/virology;Distemper/*epidemiology/pathology/*virology;Distemper Virus, Canine/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Histocytochemistry;Immunohistochemistry;In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence;Molecular Sequence Data;Phylogeny;RNA, Viral/genetics;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Russia;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Tigers/*virology",23943758,10.1128/mBio.00410-13,

Few studies have investigated the prevalence of this infection in Tunisian livestock. The present report aimed to update the epidemiological status and identify the risk factors associated with this RVF virus infection in the one-humped dromedary camel from arid areas. A total of 470 sera of apparently healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius) were collected from six governorates from southern and central Tunisia. Samples were tested by a competitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). An overall, 162 camels (34%, 95%CI: 0.1-0.4) were seropositive to RVF virus antigen. Logistic regression model revealed three potential risk factors associated with the infection. A meaningful high seropositivity was observed among aged camels (>10 years-old) (40%) (P=0.001; OR=3.367). Besides, camels raised in small flocks particularly intended for meat production showed a high level of seropositivity (37%) (P=0.013; OR=13.173).

The co-existence of multiplex viruses in the host accelerate viral variations. For effective prediction and prevention of potential epidemic or even pandemic, the metagenomics method was used to investigate the gut virome status of 45 domestic healthy dogs which have extensive contact with human beings. A total of 248.6 GB data (505, 203, 006 valid reads, 150 bp in length) were generated and 325, 339 contigs, which were best matched with viral genes, were assembled from 46, 832, 838 reads. In the aggregate, 9,834 contigs (3.02%) were confirmed for viruses. The top 30 contigs with the most reads abundance were mapped to DNA virus families Circoviridae, Parvoviridae and Herpesviridae; and RNA virus families Astroviridae, Coronaviridae and Picornaviridae, respectively. Numerous sequences were assigned to animal virus families of Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Circoviridae, etc.; and phage families of Microviridae, Siphoviridae, Ackermannviridae, Podoviridae, Myoviridae and the unclassified phages. Further, several sequences were homologous with the insect and plant viruses, which reflects the diet and habitation of dogs. Significantly, canine coronavirus was uniquely identified in all the samples with high abundance, and the phylogenetic analysis therefore showed close relationship with the human coronavirus strain 229E and NL63, indicating the potential risk of canine coronavirus to infect humans by obtaining the ability of cross-species transmission.

This study aims at investigating the risk factors for human exposure to rabid TFBs. Statistical inference based on Pearson correlation showed that there was a strong positive correlation between the total number of positive TFB rabies cases and the number of rabid TFBs involved with human activities in 81 enzootic townships (r = 0.91; p < 0.001). A logistic regression analysis indicated that the risk probability of a human being bitten by rabid TFBs was significantly higher when there were no dogs around (35.55% versus 6.17% (indoors, n = 171, p = 0.0001), and 52.00% versus 5.26% (outdoors, n = 44, p = 0.021)), and whether or not there was a dog around was the only crucial covariate that was statistically significantly related to the risk of a human being bitten. In conclusion, this study showed the value of having vaccinated pets as a deterrent to TFB encounters and as a buffer to prevent human exposure to rabid TFBs. The presence of unvaccinated pets could become a significant risk factor in the longer term if rabies isn&rsquo;t controlled in TFBs because of the spillover between the sylvatic and urban cycles of rabies.

RESULTS: We describe here the first full-length sequence of a highly divergent STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) virus obtained by PCR-based genome walking using DNA from two dried blood spots (DBS) collected from a wild-caught Cercopithecus mona monkey. The genome of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) is 8913-bp long and shares only 77% identity to other PTLV-3s. Phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian and maximum likelihood inference clearly show that this highly divergent virus forms an independent lineage with high posterior probability and bootstrap support within the diversity of PTLV-3. Molecular dating of concatenated gag-pol-env-tax sequences inferred a divergence date of about 115,117 years ago for STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) indicating an ancient origin for this newly identified lineage. Major structural, enzymatic, and regulatory gene regions of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB) are intact and suggest viral replication and a predicted pathogenic potential comparable to other PTLV-3s. CONCLUSION: When taken together, the inferred ancient origin of STLV-3d(Cmo8699AB), the presence of this highly divergent virus in two primate species from the same geographical region, and the ease with which STLVs can be transmitted across species boundaries all suggest that STLV-3d may be more prevalent and widespread. Given the high human exposure to nonhuman primates in this region and the unknown pathogenicity of this divergent PTLV-3, increased surveillance and expanded prevention activities are necessary.

In the Bwindi region of Uganda, a hot spot of mammalian biodiversity in Africa, human livelihoods are intimately connected with wildlife, creating potential for exposure to filoviruses. METHODS: We tested samples from 331 febrile patients presenting to healthcare facilities near Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Western blot, using recombinant glycoprotein antigens for Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus. Behavioral data on contact with wildlife were collected to examine risk factors for filovirus seropositivity. RESULTS: All patients were negative for active filovirus infection, by PCR analysis. However, patients were seroreactive to SUDV (4.7%), EBOV (5.3%), and BDBV (8.9%), indicating previous exposure. Touching duikers was the most significant risk factor associated with EBOV seropositivity, while hunting primates and touching and/or eating cane rats were significant risk factors for SUDV seropositivity.

Both of these viruses cause long-term, non-progressive infections in their natural host despite high plasma viral loads. This study assessed the susceptibility of rhesus macaques to infection by these two types of SIVmnd and compared the virological and basic immunological characteristics of the resulting infections with those observed in natural infection in mandrills. Whilst both SIVmnd types induced similar levels of virus replication during acute infection in both mandrills and macaques, they produced a more pronounced CD4(+) T-cell depletion in rhesus macaques that persisted longer during the initial stage of infection. Pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were also induced at higher levels in rhesus macaques early in the infection. During the chronic phase of infection in mandrills, which in this case was followed for up to 2 years after infection, high levels of chronic virus replication did not induce significant changes in CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-cell counts. In rhesus macaques, the overall chronic virus replication level was lower than in mandrills. At the end of the follow-up period, although the viral loads of SIVmnd-1 and SIVmnd-2 were relatively similar in rhesus macaques, only SIVmnd-1-infected rhesus macaques showed significant CD4(+) T-cell depletion, in the context of higher levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell activation, compared with SIVmnd-infected mandrills.

It was previously considered unable to infect humans, but the first case of human HEV-C1 infection was recently discovered in Hong Kong. The aim of this study is to further describe the features of this zoonosis in Hong Kong. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted a territory-wide prospective screening study for HEV-C1 infection over a 31-month period. Blood samples from 2,860 patients with abnormal liver function (nß=ß2,201) or immunosuppressive conditions (nß=ß659) were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. In addition, 186 captured commensal rats were screened for HEV-C1 RNA. Sequences of human-derived and rat-derived HEV-C1 isolates were compared. Epidemiological and clinical features of HEV-C1 infection were analyzed. HEV-C1 RNA was detected in 6/2,201 (0.27%) patients with hepatitis and 1/659 (0.15%) immunocompromised persons. Including the previously reported case, eight HEV-C1 infections were identified, including five in patients who were immunosuppressed. Three patients had acute hepatitis, four had persistent hepatitis, and one had subclinical infection without hepatitis. One patient died of meningoencephalitis, and HEV-C1 was detected in cerebrospinal fluid. HEV-C1 hepatitis was generally milder than HEV-A hepatitis. HEV-C1 RNA was detected in 7/186 (3.76%) rats. One HEV-C1 isolate obtained from a rat captured near the residences of patients was closely related to the major outbreak strain. CONCLUSIONS: HEV-C1 is a cause of hepatitis E in humans in Hong Kong.

METHODS: Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase gene or full-length genome sequences were generated from selected, current H1N1 viruses from wild birds, pigs and turkeys. Phylogenetic analyses were combined with genotyping and analyses of the deduced amino acid sequences with respect to biologically active sites. Antigenic relationships were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition reactions. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequences showed that viruses from distinct H1 subgroups co-circulate among domestic animals and wild birds. In addition, these viruses comprised different genotypes and were distinguishable antigenically. An H1N1 virus isolated from a turkey farm in northern Germany in 2009 showed the highest similarity with the avian-like porcine H1N1 influenza viruses circulating in Europe since the late 1970s. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate the genetic and antigenic heterogeneity of H1 viruses currently circulating in domestic and wild animals in Germany and points to turkeys as a possible bridge between avian and mammalian hosts.",Journal Article,Influenza Other Respir Viruses,5,4,276-84,"Amino Acid Sequence;Animals;Animals, Wild/*virology;Antibodies, Viral/immunology;Antigens, Viral/immunology;Cluster Analysis;Genetic Variation;Genotype;Germany;Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests;Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/genetics;Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Influenza in Birds/*transmission/virology;Neuraminidase/genetics;Orthomyxoviridae Infections/transmission/*veterinary/virology;Phylogeny;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Sequence Homology;Swine/*virology;Swine Diseases/*transmission/virology;Turkeys/*virology;Viral Proteins/genetics",21651738,10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00201.x,1750-2640 (Print);1750-2640

The most common NoV strains circulating among humans belong to genogroup GII. Thus far, to our knowledge, no HuNoVs have been detected in pets. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether pet dogs could serve as carriers for HuNoVs and thereby transmit the infection to humans. STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-two faecal samples of indoor pet dogs were obtained. The main criteria for sample collection were that the dog or humans in the household had suffered from diarrhoea or vomiting. All samples were screened for HuNoV genogroups GI, GII, and GIV by real-time one-step RT-PCR. RESULTS: We detected HuNoV in four faecal samples from pet dogs that had been in direct contact with symptomatic persons. Three of the positive samples contained genotype GII.4 variant 2006b or 2008 and one GII.12. All NoV-positive dogs lived in households with small children and two dogs showed mild symptoms.

While simian foamy virus (SFV) infection was reported in primate hunters in Cameroon and Gabon, little is known about the distribution of SFV in Africa and whether human-to-human transmission and disease occur. We screened 3,334 plasmas from persons living in rural villages in central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) using SFV-specific EIA and Western blot (WB) tests. PCR amplification of SFV polymerase sequences from DNA extracted from buffy coats was used to measure proviral loads. Phylogenetic analysis was used to define the NHP species origin of SFV. Participants completed questionnaires to capture NHP exposure information. RESULTS: Sixteen (0.5%) samples were WB-positive; 12 of 16 were from women (75%, 95% confidence limits 47.6%, 92.7%). Sequence analysis detected SFV in three women originating from Angolan colobus or red-tailed monkeys; both monkeys are hunted frequently in DRC. NHP exposure varied and infected women lived in distant villages suggesting a wide and potentially diverse distribution of SFV infections across DRC. Plasmas from 22 contacts of 8 WB-positive participants were all WB negative suggesting no secondary viral transmission. Proviral loads in the three women ranged from 14 - 1,755 copies/105 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our study documents SFV infection in rural DRC for the first time and identifies infections with novel SFV variants from Colobus and red-tailed monkeys. Unlike previous studies, women were not at lower risk for SFV infection in our population, providing opportunities for spread of SFV both horizontally and vertically. However, limited testing of close contacts of WB-positive persons did not identify human-to-human transmission. Combined with the broad behavioral risk and distribution of NHPs across DRC, our results suggest that SFV infection may have a wider geographic distribution within DRC. These results also reinforce the potential for an increased SFV prevalence throughout the forested regions of Africa where humans and simians co-exist.

While sporadic human infections with classical influenza A (H1N1) and with tr-swine influenza viruses have been reported, relatively few have been documented in occupationally exposed swine workers (SW). METHODS: We conducted a 2-year (2002-2004) prospective cohort study of transmission of influenza viruses between pigs and SW from a single pork production company in Iowa. Respiratory samples were collected and tested for influenza viruses from SW and from pigs under their care through surveillance for influenza-like illnesses (ILI). Serial blood samples from study participants were tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) for antibody seroconversion against human and swine influenza viruses (SIV), and antibody seroprevalence was compared to age-matched urban Iowa blood donors. RESULTS: During the first year, 15 of 88 SW had ILI and were sampled; all were culture-negative for influenza. During the second year, 11 of 76 SW had ILI and were sampled; one was culture-positive for a human seasonal H3N2 virus. Among 20 swine herd ILI outbreaks sampled, influenza A virus was detected by rRT-PCR from 17 with 11 trH1N1 and five trH3N2 virus isolates cultured. During both years, HI geometric mean titers were significantly higher among SW compared to blood donor controls for three SIV: classical swine Sw/WI/238/97 (H1N1), tr Sw/IN/9K035/99 (H1N2), and trSw/IA/H02NJ56371/02 (H1N1)] (P < 0?0001).

Canine distemper virus (CDV), a single-stranded RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family and genus Morbillivirus, infects and causes disease in a variety of species, not just canids. An outbreak of CDV in wild lions in the Serengeti, Tanzania, in 1994 was a wake-up call for conservationists, as it demonstrated that an infectious disease could swiftly impact a previously healthy felid population. To understand how this virus causes disease in noncanid hosts, researchers have focused on specific mutations in the binding site of the CDV hemagglutinin gene. Now, Seimon et al. provide information on CDV in its latest feline victim, the endangered wild Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) [T. A. Seimon et al., mBio 4(4):e00410-13, 2013, doi:10.1128/mBio.00410-13]. Their findings of CDV strains infecting tigers, in combination with recent information from other felids, paints a different picture, one in which CDV strains from a variety of geographic lineages and with a variety of amino acid residues in the hemagglutinin gene binding site can infect cats and cause disease.

Epidemiological and serological studies support the hypothesis that cattle represent the natural reservoir of IDV with periodical spillover events to other animal hosts. Little is known about the seroprevalence in humans and in specific target groups such as veterinarians in Italy. This study was designed to assess the prevalence of antibodies against two influenza D lineages (D/660 and D/OK) in Italy in archived serum samples from veterinarians working with swine collected in 2004. Serum samples were tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (VN) assays. Results showed that 4.88% (4/82) of tested samples were positive for D/660 and 2.44% (2/82) for D/OK by HI assay. Three out of four samples showed positivity when tested by VN assay. Our data suggest undetected IDVs might have circulated and/or been introduced in Italy as early as 2004 at least in some animal species such as swine.

Using 321 genome sequences spanning an unprecedented diversity of RABV, we compared evolutionary rates and selection pressures in viruses sampled from multiple primary host shifts that occurred on various continents. Two major phylogenetic groups, bat-related RABV and dog-related RABV, experiencing markedly different evolutionary dynamics were identified. While no correlation between time and genetic divergence was found in bat-related RABV, the evolution of dog-related RABV followed a generally clock-like structure, although with a relatively low evolutionary rate. Subsequent molecular clock dating indicated that dog-related RABV likely underwent a rapid global spread following the intensification of intercontinental trade starting in the 15th century. Strikingly, although dog RABV has jumped to various wildlife species from the order Carnivora, we found no clear evidence that these host-jumping events involved adaptive evolution, with RABV instead characterized by strong purifying selection, suggesting that ecological processes also play an important role in shaping patterns of emergence. However, specific amino acid changes were associated with the parallel emergence of RABV in ferret-badgers in Asia, and some host shifts were associated with increases in evolutionary rate, particularly in the ferret-badger and mongoose, implying that changes in host species can have important impacts on evolutionary dynamics.",Journal Article,PLoS Pathog,12,12,e1006041,"Animals;Animals, Wild/*virology;*Biological Evolution;Carnivora;Genome, Viral;High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing;Host-Pathogen Interactions/*physiology;Humans;Phylogeny;RNA, Viral/genetics;Rabies/*veterinary;Rabies virus/*genetics;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Zoonoses/transmission",27977811,10.1371/journal.ppat.1006041,1553-7366 (Print);1553-7366

In this present study, we assessed the pathogenicity of the clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 HPAIV in American kestrels (Falco sparverius) with a view to preventing future outbreaks in raptors. The kestrels were intranasally inoculated with the virus or fed the meat of chicks that had died from viral infection. Kestrels in both groups initially had reduced food intake, showed clinical signs such as depression and neurologic manifestations, and succumbed to the infection within 6 days. The kestrels primarily shed the virus orally from 1 day post-inoculation until death, with an average titre of 10(4.5-5.7) EID(50)/ml, which is comparable to the inoculum titre. The viruses replicated in almost all tested tissues; notably, the feather calamuses also contained infectious virions and/or viral genes. Pancreatic lesions were present in several infected birds, as shown in previous cases of HPAIV infection in raptors. These results indicate that kestrels are highly susceptible to infection by clade 2.3.2.1 H5 HPAIVs, which readily occurs through the consumption of infected bird carcasses. Early detection and removal of HPAIV infected carcasses in the field is essential for preventing outbreaks in raptors.

Since 1986, RHDV has caused outbreaks in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Europe, but never in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus, EBH). In 2010, a new RHDV-related virus, called RHDV2, emerged in Europe, causing extended epidemics because it largely overcame the immunity to RHDV present in most rabbit populations. RHDV2 also was identified in Cape hare (Lepus capensis subsp. mediterraneus) and in Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus). Here, we describe two distinct incidents of RHDV2 infection in EBH that occurred in Italy (2012) and Spain (2014). The two RHDV2 strains caused macroscopic and microscopic lesions similar to European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in hares, and they were genetically related to other RHDV2 strains in Europe. EBHs are common in Europe, often sharing habitat with rabbits. They likely have been exposed to high levels of RHDV2 during outbreaks in rabbits in recent years, yet only two incidents of RHDV2 in EBHs have been found in Italy and Spain, suggesting that EBHs are not a primary host. Instead, they may act as spillover hosts inßsituations when infection pressure is high and barriers between rabbits and hares are limited, resulting in occasional infections causing EBHS-like lesions.

A propensity for host-switching has resulted in CDV emergence in new species, including endangered wildlife, posing challenges for controlling disease in multispecies communities. CDV is typically associated with domestic dogs, but little is known about its maintenance and transmission in species-rich areas or about the potential role of domestic dog vaccination as a means of reducing disease threats to wildlife. We address these questions by analyzing a long-term serological dataset of CDV in lions and domestic dogs from Tanzania's Serengeti ecosystem. Using a Bayesian state-space model, we show that dynamics of CDV have changed considerably over the past three decades. Initially, peaks of CDV infection in dogs preceded those in lions, suggesting that spill-over from dogs was the main driver of infection in wildlife. However, despite dog-to-lion transmission dominating cross-species transmission models, infection peaks in lions became more frequent and asynchronous from those in dogs, suggesting that other wildlife species may play a role in a potentially complex maintenance community. Widespread mass vaccination of domestic dogs reduced the probability of infection in dogs and the size of outbreaks but did not prevent transmission to or peaks of infection in lions.

Here we aim to elucidate the role of house-roosting bats in the DENV transmission cycle. Bats were sampled in households located in high and low dengue incidence regions during rainy and dry seasons in Costa Rica. We captured 318 bats from 12 different species in 29 households. Necropsies were performed in 205 bats to analyze virus presence in heart, lung, spleen, liver, intestine, kidney, and brain tissue. Histopathology studies from all organs showed no significant findings of disease or infection. Sera were analyzed by PRNT90 for a seroprevalence of 21.2% (51/241), and by PCR for 8.8% (28/318) positive bats for DENV RNA. From these 28 bats, 11 intestine samples were analyzed by RT-PCR. Two intestines were DENV RNA positive for the same dengue serotype detected in blood. Viral isolation from all positive organs or blood was unsuccessful. Additionally, viral load analyses in positive blood samples by qRT-PCR showed virus concentrations under the minimal dose required for mosquito infection. Simultaneously, 651 mosquitoes were collected using EVS-CO2 traps and analyzed for DENV and feeding preferences (bat cytochrome b). Only three mosquitoes were found DENV positive and none was positive for bat cytochrome b. Our results suggest an accidental presence of DENV in bats probably caused from oral ingestion of infected mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest also a spillover event from humans to bats. Therefore, we conclude that bats in these urban environments do not sustain DENV amplification, they do not have a role as reservoirs, but function as epidemiological dead end hosts for this virus.",Journal Article,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,11,5,e0005537,"Animal Structures/virology;Animals;Antibodies, Viral/*blood;Chiroptera/*virology;Costa Rica;Dengue Virus/immunology/*isolation & purification;Female;Humans;Immunoassay;Male;RNA, Viral/*blood;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Seroepidemiologic Studies;Urban Population;Viral Load",28545090,10.1371/journal.pntd.0005537,1935-2727 (Print);1935-2727

Despite increasing knowledge on influenza A virus dynamics in wild birds, the viral circulation in wild boars remains largely unknown. This is of particular interest since pigs can be infected with both human and avian viruses; upon co-infection, they can act as a mixing vessel through reassortment, a mechanism that resulted in the emergence of the pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009. The Camargue (Southern France) appears as an ideal study area to investigate inter-species transmission of influenza A viruses from wild birds and possibly humans to wild boars. Indeed, the important local wild boar population shares wetland use with humans and the largest concentration of wintering ducks in France, that are both susceptible to infection by influenza A viruses. Additionally, wild boars occasionally prey on ducks. We conducted a virological and serological survey on wild boars in the Camargue (Southern France) between September 2009 and November 2010. No influenza A virus was detected in the collected nasal swabs (n=315) and no influenza specific antibodies were observed in the serological samples (n=20). As the study was mainly focused on viral excretion, which is limited in time, we cannot exclude that low or occasional influenza A virus circulation took place during the study period.

A zoonotic, vector-borne alphavirus, Madariaga virus (MADV; formerly known as South American eastern equine encephalitis virus), caused its first documented human outbreak in 2010 in Darien, Panama, where the genetically similar Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is endemic. We report the results of a seroprevalence survey of animals and humans, illustrating contrasting features of MADV and VEEV ecology and epidemiology. METHODS: Small mammals were trapped in 42 sites in Darien, Panama, using Sherman traps, Tomahawk traps, and mist nets for bats. Blood was tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to MADV and VEEV. In addition, bird sera collected in 2007 in Chagres, Panama, were tested for MADV and VEEV neutralizing antibodies. Viremia was ascertained by RT-PCR. Human exposure to these two viruses was determined by IgG ELISA, followed by plaque reduction neutralization tests. To identify relevant risk factors for MADV or VEEV exposure, logistic regression analysis was performed, and the most parsimonious model was selected based on the Akaike information criterion. RESULTS: The animal survey yielded 32 bats (16 species), 556 rodents (12 species), and 20 opossums (4 species). The short-tailed cane mouse (Zygodontomys brevicauda) found abundantly in pasture and farms, had the highest MADV seroprevalence (8.3%). For VEEV, the shrub and forest-dwelling long-whiskered rice rat (Transandinomys bolivaris) had the highest seroprevalence (19.0%). Viremia was detected in one animal (Z. brevicauda). Of the 159 bird sera (50 species) tested, none were positive for either virus. In humans (n = 770), neutralizing antibodies to MADV and VEEV were present in 4.8% and 31.5%, respectively. MADV seropositivity was positively associated with cattle ranching, farming, and fishing. Having VEEV antibodies and shrubs near the house diminished risk. Age, forest work, farming and fishing were risk factors for VEEV, while having MADV antibodies, glazed windows, waste pick-up and piped water were protective. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the short-tailed cane mouse and the long-whiskered rice rat serve as hosts for MADV and VEEV, respectively. The preferred habitat of these rodent species coincides with areas associated with human infection risk. Our findings also indicate that MADV emerged recently in humans, and that the transmission cycles of these two sympatric alphaviruses differ spatially and in host utilization.",Journal Article,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,10,4,e0004554,"Alphavirus/*immunology/isolation & purification;Alphavirus Infections/*epidemiology/virology;Animals;Antibodies, Neutralizing/blood;Antibodies, Viral/*blood;Birds;Cross-Sectional Studies;Disease Reservoirs;Encephalitis, Viral/*epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay;Humans;Immunoglobulin G/blood;Mammals;Neutralization Tests;Panama/epidemiology;RNA, Viral/blood;Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction;Seroepidemiologic Studies;Viral Plaque Assay;Viremia/diagnosis;Zoonoses/*epidemiology/virology",27101567,10.1371/journal.pntd.0004554,1935-2727 (Print);1935-2727

More than 300 cases in this ""high-lymphoma stock"" have been registered since 1967. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-related virus was implicated as the etiologic agent of Sukhumi baboon lymphoma. The origin of this virus remained unclear. Two possibilities were originally considered: the origin could be baboon simian T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (STLV-1) or HTLV-1 (before the outbreak started, some Sukhumi baboons were inoculated with human leukemic material). The third possibility entered recently: interspecies transmission of rhesus macaque STLV-1 to baboons. It was prompted by the finding of very close similarity between STLV-1 991-1cc (the strain isolated from a non-Sukhumi baboon inoculated with material from a Sukhumi lymphomatous baboon) and rhesus STLV-1. To test this hypothesis, we investigated 37 Sukhumi STLV-1 isolates from baboons of high-lymphoma stock by PCR discriminating rhesus type and baboon type STLV-1 isolates. All of them were proved to be rhesus type STLV-1. In contrast, all six STLV-1 isolates from baboons belonging to other stocks or populations were of baboon type. The PCR results were fully confirmed by DNA sequence data. The partial env gene gene sequences of all four STLV-1 isolates from Sukhumi lymphomatous baboons were 97 to 100% similar to the sequence of known rhesus STLV-1 and only 85% homologous with the sequence of conventional baboon STLV-1. Thus, interspecies transmission of STLV-1 from rhesus macaques (or closely related species) to baboons occurred at Sukhumi Primate Center.

R.",2019,Limited Intrahost Diversity and Background Evolution Accompany 40 Years of Canine Parvovirus Host Adaptation and Spread,"Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a highly successful pathogen that has sustained pandemic circulation in dogs for more than 40 years. Here, integrating full-genome and deep-sequencing analyses, structural information, and in vitro experimentation, we describe the macro- and microscale features that accompany CPV's evolutionary success. Despite 40 years of viral evolution, all CPV variants are more than ?99% identical in nucleotide sequence, with only a limited number (<40) of substitutions becoming fixed or widespread during this time. Notably, most substitutions in the major capsid protein (VP2) gene are nonsynonymous, altering amino acid residues that fall within, or adjacent to, the overlapping receptor footprint or antigenic regions, suggesting that natural selection has channeled much of CPV evolution. Among the limited number of variable sites, CPV genomes exhibit complex patterns of variation that include parallel evolution, reversion, and recombination, compromising phylogenetic inference. At the intrahost level, deep sequencing of viral DNA in original clinical samples from dogs and other host species sampled between 1978 and 2018 revealed few subconsensus single nucleotide variants (SNVs) above ?0.5%, and experimental passages demonstrate that substantial preexisting genetic variation is not necessarily required for rapid host receptor-driven adaptation. Together, these findings suggest that although CPV is capable of rapid host adaptation, a relatively low mutation rate, pleiotropy, and/or a lack of selective challenges since its initial emergence have inhibited the long-term accumulation of genetic diversity. Hence, continuously high levels of inter- and intrahost diversity are not necessarily required for virus host adaptation.IMPORTANCE Rapid mutation rates and correspondingly high levels of intra- and interhost diversity are often cited as key features of viruses with the capacity for emergence and sustained transmission in a new host species. However, most of this information comes from studies of RNA viruses, with relatively little known about evolutionary processes in viruses with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes. Here, we provide a unique model of virus evolution, integrating both long-term global-scale and short-term intrahost evolutionary processes of an ssDNA virus that emerged to cause a pandemic in a new host animal. Our analysis reveals that successful host jumping and sustained transmission does not necessarily depend on a high level of intrahost diversity nor result in the continued accumulation of high levels of long-term evolution change. These findings indicate that all aspects of the biology and ecology of a virus are relevant when considering their adaptability.",Journal Article,J Virol,94,1,,"Adaptation, Physiological/genetics;Animals;Biological Evolution;Capsid Proteins/classification/*genetics/metabolism;DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism;Dog Diseases/*epidemiology/transmission/virology;Dogs;Foxes/virology;*Genome, Viral;Host Specificity/genetics;Models, Molecular;Mutation;Parvoviridae Infections/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary/virology;Parvovirus, Canine/classification/*genetics/pathogenicity;Phylogeny;Protein Conformation;Raccoon Dogs/virology;Raccoons/virology;Viral Nonstructural Proteins/classification/*genetics/metabolism;Whole Genome Sequencing;*canine parvovirus;*deep sequencing;*viral cross-species transmission;*viral evolution;*viral host adaption;*viral intrahost diversity",31619551,10.1128/jvi.01162-19,0022-538X (Print);0022-538x

Because the rate at which FMDV mutations accumulated in persistently infected buffaloes was approximately linear (1.64 percent nucleotide substitutions per year over the region of the 1D gene sequenced), both buffaloes and cattle that became infected some months after the start of the experiment were infected with viruses that differed from the original clone.

To understand the epidemiology and emergence of HFRS in Longquan, which may be indicative of large parts of rural China, we studied long-term incidence patterns and performed a molecular epidemiological investigation of the causative hantaviruses in human and rodent populations. METHOD/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During 1974-2011, 1866 cases of HFRS were recorded in Longquan, including 20 deaths. In 2011, the incidence of HFRS remained high, with 19.61 cases/100,000 population, despite the onset of vaccination in 1997. During 1974-1998, HFRS cases in Longquan occurred mainly in winter, while in the past decade the peak of HFRS has shifted to the spring. Notably, the concurrent prevalence of rodent-borne hantaviruses in the region was also high. Phylogenetic analyses of viral sequences recovered from rodents in Longquan revealed the presence of novel genetic variants of Gou virus (GOUV) in Rattus sp. rats and Hantaan virus (HTNV) in the stripe field mice, respectively. Strikingly, viral sequences sampled from infected humans were very closely related to those from rodents. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: HFRS represents an important public health problem in Longquan even after years of preventive measures. Our data suggest that continual spillover of the novel genetic variant of GOUV and the new genetic lineage of HTNV are responsible for the high prevalence of HFRS in humans. In addition, this is the first report of GOUV associated with human HFRS cases, and our data suggest that GOUV is now the major cause of HFRS in this region.",Journal Article,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,7,10,e2484,"Animals;China/epidemiology;Cluster Analysis;Hantavirus/*classification/genetics/*isolation & purification;Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome/*epidemiology/*veterinary/virology;Humans;Incidence;Mice;Molecular Epidemiology;Molecular Sequence Data;Phylogeny;Prevalence;RNA, Viral/genetics;Rats;Rodent Diseases/*epidemiology/virology;Seasons;Sequence Analysis, DNA;Zoonoses/*epidemiology/*virology",24147168,10.1371/journal.pntd.0002484,1935-2727 (Print);1935-2727

The isolation of H3N2 influenza viruses from a wide range of lower animals and birds suggests that influenza viruses of man can spread to the lower orders. Under some conditions the H3N2 viruses can persist for a number of years in some species. The isolation, from aquatic birds, of a large number of influenza A viruses that possess surface proteins antigenically similar to the viruses isolated from man, pigs and horses provides indirect evidence for inter-species transmission. There is now a considerable body of evidence which suggests that influenza viruses of lower animals and birds may play a role in the origin of some of the pandemic strains of influenza A viruses. There is no direct evidence that the influenza viruses in aquatic birds are transmitted to man, but they may serve as a genetic pool from which some genes may be introduced into humans by recombination.

Understanding the evolutionary epidemiology of spillover events leading to discrete outcomes in novel hosts is key to predicting risk and can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of emergence. Here we use a Bayesian phylodynamic approach to examine cross-species transmission and evolutionary dynamics during a canine distemper virus (CDV) spillover event causing clinical disease and population decline in an African lion population (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti Ecological Region between 1993 and 1994. Using 21 near-complete viral genomes from four species we found that this large-scale outbreak was likelyß ignited by a single cross-species spillover event from a canid reservoir to noncanid hosts <1ßyear before disease detection and explosive spread of CDV in lions. Cross-species transmission from other noncanid species probably fuelled the high prevalence of CDV across spatially structured lion prides. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) could have acted as the proximate source of CDV exposure in lions. We report 13 nucleotide substitutions segregating CDV strains found in canids and noncanids. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that virus evolution played a role in CDV emergence in noncanid hosts following spillover during the outbreak, suggest that host barriers to clinical infection can limit outcomes of CDV spillover in novel host species.",Journal Article,Mol Ecol,29,22,4308-4321,"Animals;Animals, Wild;Bayes Theorem;*Distemper/epidemiology;*Distemper Virus, Canine/genetics;*Lions;Parks, Recreational;*African lion;*Serengeti;*canine distemper virus;*carnivore conservation;*evolutionary epidemiology;*pathogen spillover",32306443,10.1111/mec.15449,0962-1083

Although NDV has been studied in Nigeria, genetic information about the viruses involved in the endemicity of the disease and the transmission that likely occurs at the poultry-wildlife interface is still largely incomplete. Next-generation and Sanger sequencing was performed to provide complete (n = 73) and partial genomic sequence data (n = 38) for NDV isolates collected from domestic and wild birds in Nigeria during 2002-2015, including the first complete genome sequences of genotype IV and subgenotype VIh from the African continent. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that viruses of seven different genotypes circulated in that period, demonstrating high genetic diversity of NDV for a single country. In addition, a high degree of similarity between NDV isolates from domestic and wild birds was observed, suggesting that spillovers had occurred, including to three species that had not previously been shown to be susceptible to NDV infection. Furthermore, the first spillover of a mesogenic Komarov vaccine virus is documented, suggesting a previous spillover and evolution of this virus. The similarities between viruses from poultry and multiple bird species and the lack of evidence for host adaptation in codon usage suggest that transmission of NDV between poultry and non-poultry birds occurred recently.

Tracing virus origin and predicting the most likely host species for future spillover events are major objectives in One Health disciplines.We assessed patterns of virus sharing among a large diversity of mammals, including humans and domestic species. LOCATION: Global. TIME PERIOD: Current. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Mammals and associated viruses. METHODS: We used network centrality analysis and trait-based Bayesian hierarchical models to explore patterns of virus sharing among mammals. We analysed a global database that compiled the associations between 1,785 virus species and 725 mammalian host species as sourced from automatic screening of meta-data accompanying published nucleotide sequences between 1950 and 2019. RESULTS: We show that based on current evidence, domesticated mammals hold the most central positions in networks of known mammal-virus associations. Among entire host-virus networks, Carnivora and Chiroptera hold central positions for mainly sharing RNA viruses, whereas ungulates hold central positions for sharing both RNA and DNA viruses with other host species. We revealed strong evidence that DNA viruses were phylogenetically more host specific than RNA viruses. RNA viruses exhibited low functional host specificity despite an overall tendency to infect phylogenetically related species, signifying high potential to shift across hosts with different ecological niches. The frequencies of sharing viruses among hosts and the proportion of zoonotic viruses in hosts were larger for RNA than for DNA viruses.

These facts, along with the finding that HTLV-1 diversity appears to have resulted from multiple cross-species transmissions of STLV-1, suggest that contact between humans and infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) may result in HTLV emergence. We investigated the diversity of HTLV among central Africans reporting contact with NHP blood and body fluids through hunting, butchering, and keeping primate pets. We show that this population is infected with a wide variety of HTLVs, including two previously unknown retroviruses: HTLV-4 is a member of a phylogenetic lineage that is distinct from all known HTLVs and STLVs; HTLV-3 falls within the phylogenetic diversity of STLV-3, a group not previously seen in humans.

Although SIV and other primate retroviruses infect laboratory workers and zoo workers, zoonotic retrovirus transmission has not been documented in natural settings. We investigated zoonotic infection in individuals living in central Africa. METHODS: We obtained behavioural data, plasma samples, and peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals living in rural villages in Cameroon. We did serological testing, PCR, and sequence analysis to obtain evidence of retrovirus infection. FINDINGS: Zoonotic infections with simian foamy virus (SFV), a retrovirus endemic in most Old World primates, were identified in people living in central African forests who reported direct contact with blood and body fluids of wild non-human primates. Ten (1%) of 1099 individuals had antibodies to SFV. Sequence analysis from these individuals revealed three geographically-independent human SFV infections, each of which was acquired from a distinct non-human primate lineage: De Brazza's guenon (Cercopithecus neglectus), mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), two of which (De Brazza's guenon and mandrill) are naturally infected with SIV. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show that retroviruses are actively crossing into human populations, and demonstrate that people in central Africa are currently infected with SFV. Contact with non-human primates, such as happens during hunting and butchering, can play a part in the emergence of human retroviruses and the reduction of primate bushmeat hunting has the potential to decrease the frequency of disease emergence.",Journal Article,Lancet,363,9413,932-7,"Animals;Cameroon/epidemiology;Cercopithecus;Communicable Diseases, Emerging/transmission/veterinary/virology;Gorilla gorilla;Humans;Papio;Primates/*virology;Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/*transmission/*veterinary;Retroviruses, Simian/*isolation & purification;Spumavirus/isolation & purification;Zoonoses/epidemiology/*transmission",15043960,10.1016/s0140-6736(04)15787-5,0140-6736

Our results revealed the persistent nature of dog rabies in Algeria; with a mean of 131 positive cases per year. The vaccination coverage findings indicated that 30.81% (126/409) of the reported vaccinated dog and 47.98% (261/544) of all studied dogs presented low level of rabies antibodies titres (less than 0.5 IU), and were therefore considered not immune to rabies. Additionally, our vaccine evaluation findigs showed a weak immune response of inactivated vaccine without adjuvant. Even with adjuvanted inactivated and attenuated live vaccines, several vaccinated dogs did not develop vaccine protection. Therefore, our results recommend further studies to test the efficiency of adding a booster vaccine shot, especially in primo-vaccinated dogs to optimize the vaccination protocol; rabies is potentially fatal zoonosis, tolerating no vaccine failure.

The virus tends to remain within the species of origin; nonetheless, naturally occurring cross-species transmission of FLUAV has been periodically documented. Multiple cross-species transmissions of FLUAV have been reported from companion animals and captive wild animals, neither of which is historically considered as natural hosts of FLUAV. In the fall of 2010, mink (Mustela vison) inhabiting a 15,000-head mink farm in the Midwest United States experienced persistent severe respiratory distress and nose and/or mouth bleeding. Mink losses averaged approximately 10 animals per day. Six dead mink at 6 months of age were submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for diagnostic investigation. Gross and microscopic examinations revealed that all 6 mink had hemorrhagic bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Hemolytic Escherichia coli was isolated from lungs, probably accounting for hemorrhagic pneumonia. All animals tested negative for Canine distemper virus and Aleutian mink disease virus. Interestingly, FLUAV of H1N2 subtype, which contained the matrix gene of swine lineage, was detected in the lungs. Serological follow-up on mink that remained in the ranch until pelting also confirmed that the ranch had been exposed to FLUAV of H1 subtype (? clade). The case study suggests that FLUAV should be included in the differential diagnosis when mink experience epidemics of respiratory disease.

The spike 0-domain retains homology to CCoV2b (enteric infections) and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV; enteric and respiratory). This domain is subject to relaxed selection pressure and an increased rate of molecular evolution. It contains unique amino acid substitutions, including within a region important for sialic acid binding and pathogenesis in TGEV. Overall, the spike gene is extensively recombinant, with a feline coronavirus type II strain serving a prominent role in the recombinant history of the virus. Molecular divergence time for a segment of the gene where temporal signal could be determined, was estimated at around 60 years ago.

To investigate the infectivity of novel HEVs in rabbits and to assess whether rabbits are appropriate animal models for these HEVs, we inoculated Japanese white rabbits with HEV-5, HEV-7, and HEV-8, respectively. We observed that viral RNA was present in the fecal specimens of the HEV-8-inoculated rabbits and anti-HEV IgG antibodies were present in its sera, although anti-HEV IgM was undetectable and no significant elevation of ALT was observed. These results indicated that HEV-8 crossed species and infected the rabbits. No evidence for replication was observed in HEV-5 and HEV-7, suggesting that rabbits are not susceptible to these genotypes. The antibodies elicited in the HEV-8-infected rabbits did not protect them from the rabbit HEV challenge, suggesting that the antigenicity differs between HEV-8 and rabbit HEV.

F.",2020,Tissue Tropisms of Avian Influenza A Viruses Affect Their Spillovers from Wild Birds to Pigs,"Wild aquatic birds maintain a large, genetically diverse pool of influenza A viruses (IAVs), which can be transmitted to lower mammals and, ultimately, humans. Through phenotypic analyses of viral replication efficiency, only a small set of avian IAVs were found to replicate well in epithelial cells of the swine upper respiratory tract, and these viruses were shown to infect and cause virus shedding in pigs. Such a phenotypic trait of the viral replication efficiency appears to emerge randomly and is distributed among IAVs across multiple avian species and geographic and temporal orders. It is not determined by receptor binding preference but is determined by other markers across genomic segments, such as those in the ribonucleoprotein complex. This study demonstrates that phenotypic variants of viral replication efficiency exist among avian IAVs but that only a few of these may result in viral shedding in pigs upon infection, providing opportunities for these viruses to become adapted to pigs, thus posing a higher potential risk for creating novel variants or detrimental reassortants within pig populations.IMPORTANCE Swine serve as a mixing vessel for generating pandemic strains of human influenza virus. All hemagglutinin subtypes of IAVs can infect swine; however, only sporadic cases of infection with avian IAVs are reported in domestic swine. The molecular mechanisms affecting the ability of avian IAVs to infect swine are still not fully understood. From the findings of phenotypic analyses, this study suggests that the tissue tropisms (i.e., in swine upper respiratory tracts) of avian IAVs affect their spillovers from wild birds to pigs. It was found that this phenotype is determined not by receptor binding preference but is determined by other markers across genomic segments, such as those in the ribonucleoprotein complex. In addition, our results show that such a phenotypic trait was sporadically and randomly distributed among IAVs across multiple avian species and geographic and temporal orders.

Based on sequence analysis of the H gene, wild-type CDV strains cluster into distinct geographic lineages (genotypes), irrespective of the species of isolation. The sequence of the H gene of 28 CDV strains detected from both vaccinated and non-vaccinated breeding foxes, raccoon dogs and minks from different geographical areas of China during the years 2004-2008 was determined. All the CDV strains but two (strains HL and HLJ2) were characterized as Asia-1 genotype and were highly similar to each other (96.2-99.7% at the amino acid [aa] level) and to other Asia-1 strains (96.1-99.5% aa) previously detected in China. The CDV strains HL and HLJ2 were both collected from foxes in Heilongjiang province in 2005. Strain HL resembled CDVs of the Arctic genotype (GR88-like) and displayed high aa identity (98.0%) to the Chinese canine strain Liu. By converse, strain HLJ2 was barely related to CDVs of the Asia-2 genotype (88.7-90.3% aa identity), and could represent a novel CDV genotype, tentatively proposed as Asia-3. These results suggest that at least three different CDV genotypes, distantly related (81.8-91.6% aa identity) to the vaccine strains, Onderstepoort-like (America-1 genotype), are currently circulating in breeding foxes, raccoon dogs and minks in China, and that the genotype Asia-1 is predominant.

ERVs are common in vertebrate genomes and provide a valuable fossil record of past retroviral infections to investigate the biology and evolution of retroviruses over a deep time scale, including cross-species transmission events. Here we took advantage of a catalog of ERVs we recently produced for the bat Myotis lucifugus to seek evidence for infiltration of these retroviruses in other mammalian species (>100) currently represented in the genome sequence database. We provide multiple lines of evidence for the cross-ordinal transmission of a gammaretrovirus endogenized independently in the lineages of vespertilionid bats, felid cats and pangolin ~13-25 million years ago. Following its initial introduction, the ERV amplified extensively in parallel in both bat and cat lineages, generating hundreds of species-specific insertions throughout evolution. However, despite being derived from the same viral species, phylogenetic and selection analyses suggest that the ERV experienced different amplification dynamics in the two mammalian lineages. In the cat lineage, the ERV appears to have expanded primarily by retrotransposition of a single proviral progenitor that lost infectious capacity shortly after endogenization. In the bat lineage, the ERV followed a more complex path of germline invasion characterized by both retrotransposition and multiple infection events. The results also suggest that some of the bat ERVs have maintained infectious capacity for extended period of time and may be still infectious today. This study provides one of the most rigorously documented cases of cross-ordinal transmission of a mammalian retrovirus. It also illustrates how the same retrovirus species has transitioned multiple times from an infectious pathogen to a genomic parasite (i.e. retrotransposon), yet experiencing different invasion dynamics in different mammalian hosts.",Journal Article,PLoS Pathog,11,11,e1005279,"Animals;Cats;Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics;Evolution, Molecular;Genetic Variation/genetics;Genomics;Phylogeny;Recombination, Genetic/*genetics;Retroviridae Infections/*virology;Species Specificity;Vertebrates/*genetics",26562410,10.1371/journal.ppat.1005279,1553-7366 (Print);1553-7366

R.",2017,Natural exposure of bats in Grenada to rabies virus,"Introduction: Grenada is a rabies endemic country, where terrestrial rabies is maintained in the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus). The role of bats in the epidemiology of rabies in Grenada is unknown. A 1974 report described one rabies virus positive Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), and a high seroprevalence in this species. In the current study, the natural exposure to rabies virus in Grenadian bats was re-evaluated. It is postulated that bats serve as a natural rabies reservoir, probably circulating a bat-specific rabies virus variant. Material and methods: Bats were trapped in 2015 in all six parishes of Grenada using mist- and hand nets. For the detection of rabies virus in brain tissue, the direct fluorescent antibody test (dFAT) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used. Serum neutralizing antibodies were determined using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN). Results and discussion: Brain tissue and sera from 111 insectivorous and frugivorous bats belonging to four species were tested (52 Artibeus jamaicensis, two Artibeus lituratus, 33 Glossophaga longirostris, 24 Molossus molossus). Rabies virus antigen and genomic RNA were not detected in brain tissues. Rabies virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of eight A. jamaicensis in four of the six parishes. Bats in Grenada continue to show natural exposure to rabies virus. As rabies virus was not isolated in this study, serology alone is not sufficient to determine the strain of rabies virus circulating in A. jamaicensis bats in Grenada. Conclusion: Artibeus jamaicensis appears to play a role as a reservoir bat species, which is of public health concern in Grenada. Dispersion of bats to neighboring islands is possible and serological bat surveys should be initiated in these neighboring states, especially in those areas that are free of rabies in terrestrial mammals.",Journal Article,Infect Ecol Epidemiol,7,1,1332935,Artibeus jamaicensis;Grenada;bats;rabies;serology;virus,28804595,10.1080/20008686.2017.1332935,2000-8686 (Print);2000-8686

Its transmission cycle involves mosquito species as vectors as well as wild birds that act as natural reservoir hosts. In Germany, SINV was first time observed in 2009 in different mosquito species in the Upper Rhine valley and one year later in a hooded crow in Berlin. Recently, SINV was also detected repeatedly at various locations in Germany in the context of a mosquitoes monitoring program for arboviruses. In this study, we detected for just the second time a SINV infection in a diseased wild bird (common wood pigeon) from Central Europe. SINV was isolated by cell culture and the complete SINV genome sequence was determined. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a close affiliation to SINV genotype I with a high similarity to human isolate sequences from Finland, Sweden and Russia. The isolate was genetically distinct from the first avian isolate suggesting the circulation of at least two different SINV strains in Germany. In order to reveal the infection frequency in SINV positive mosquito regions 749 bird blood samples were assayed serologically and SINV antibodies found primarily in resident birds.
